"In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?",The lazy farmer is his mother.,The lazy farmer is not a responsible father as he is lazy.,The diligent farmer devoted himself to the farm and gradually forgot his father.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The lazy farmer is his mother.""
Explanation: This option suggests that the lazy farmer is actually the mother of the hardworking farmer. This would explain the relationship where the hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. This interpretation challenges the default assumption that farmers are always male, and introduces a twist to the familial relationship in the riddle.

How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?",One hundred people.,Ninty-five people.,Five people.,None of above.,3,"Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""
Explanation: The riddle states that 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. If you pick 100 names at random, it does not mean that exactly 5 people will have unlisted numbers. The 5% is a proportion, so the actual number of people with unlisted numbers could vary. Therefore, none of the options provided are correct."

"When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, ""No John, not the gun!"" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?","The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that ""John"" was the mail man.",The policeman think a doctor or a lawyer won't have name John.,The dead man was the relative of both doctor and lawyer.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that 'John' was the mail man.""

This option provides a logical explanation for how the cop quickly recognized the man as the mail man based on the fact that he was the only male among the doctor, lawyer, and priest. This reasoning aligns with the information given in the riddle and helps solve the puzzle."
"A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take ?",Three hours.,Two and a half hours.,Two hours.,None of above.,3,"Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""

Explanation: The riddle states that the driver needs to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. This means the stops are not cumulative, but rather individual stops every half an hour. Therefore, the stops would take a total of 2.5 hours (0.5 hours x 5 stops = 2.5 hours), which is not represented in any of the given options."
"Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?",Water in the tank can reflect each other in some degree.,The fish tank was like a ring.,Fish had an unusual vision so they can see what happend behind them.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""The fish tank was like a ring.""

Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?,Black sheep do not need food. ,"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.",Because there are less black sheep in the world than white.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.""

Explanation: Black color absorbs more heat from sunlight compared to white color. Therefore, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature, which could be a reason why black sheep eat less than white sheep."
"The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied ""yes"" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?","They were triplets.
",One of the gril was not loved by their family.,Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""They were triplets.""

Explanation: The most logical explanation for the scenario presented in the riddle is that the two girls, who have the same appearance and share the same birthday, are actually triplets. This would mean that they are related to each other, have parents who look alike, and share the same birthday, but are not identical twins. Triplets are siblings born from the same pregnancy, which fits all the criteria mentioned in the riddle.

Therefore, the best option to solve the riddle is: Option 1"
Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?,The ground is not wet.,"By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.",The third man is walking on his hands.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.""

Explanation: This option provides a creative solution to the riddle by suggesting that the third man is walking on stilts, which would keep his feet dry by elevating them above the muddy meadow. This explanation aligns with the riddle's context and logic, making it the most plausible answer."
"Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?",The fat dog was the father when it is thin.,The fat dog is the mother.,The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""The fat dog is the mother.""
Explanation: In this riddle, the key is to realize that the relationship between the dogs is not based on traditional gender roles. The fat dog being the mother explains how the little dog can be the son of the fat dog without the fat dog being the father of the thin dog. This challenges our default assumptions about familial relationships and gender roles."
"Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. ""Why are you smiling?"" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?",The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.,"Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.",One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.""

Explanation: This option provides a logical explanation for how one guard could see the other guard smiling. If they were facing each other, even though they were looking in opposite directions, it would be possible for one guard to see the other guard's facial expression. This scenario allows for the interaction between the guards and the observation of the smiling guard."
In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?,In the first year of each century.,It happens every year.,In the period of BC.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""It happens every year.""

Explanation: Christmas Day always falls on December 25th, and New Year's Day always falls on January 1st. Since December comes before January in the calendar year, Christmas Day and New Year's Day always fall in the same year. This is a logical and consistent occurrence every year."
"When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for yelllowstone, what will happen ?",White.,Red.,Yellow.,None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""Yellow.""

Explanation: Just like how a white shirt on a red and wet stone will turn red, putting a white shirt on a yellow stone would make the shirt yellow. The color of the stone transfers to the shirt, so in this case, the white shirt would become yellow when placed on a yellow stone."
"If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?",The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.,The other end is not tied to anything.,"The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.",None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""The other end is not tied to anything.""
Explanation: Just like in the previous riddles, the key here is to realize that the lion can move freely since the other end of the rope is not tied to anything. This allows the lion to reach the human that is 7m away."

How many legs are there on the ground?","Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.","Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.","Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.",None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.""

Explanation: The riddle specifies that you stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. Since you are lying on the bed, your two legs are off the ground. The bed has four legs, making a total of six legs on the ground. The other animals mentioned in the riddle are on the bed or above it, so they do not contribute to the legs on the ground."
"A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a cruise. How is that even doable?",The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.,"She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.",The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.""

Explanation: This option suggests that the woman actually jumped back into her apartment from the balcony, rather than falling off the building. This would explain why the fireman was not able to reach her in time and why her injuries were not worse than a bruise."
Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?,A superstar.,A barber.,A woman.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""A barber.""
Explanation: The answer to this riddle is a barber because a barber shaves other people's beards multiple times a day while maintaining his own beard. This is possible because he is not shaving his own beard but rather those of his clients."
How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?,You need to drop the egg gently.,"
You need to drop the egg hard.","No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack
",None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack.""

Explanation: The answer to this riddle lies in the fact that dropping a raw egg onto a concrete floor will not crack it because concrete floors are hard and solid surfaces. The impact of the egg hitting the concrete floor will be absorbed by the floor itself, preventing the egg from cracking. Therefore, the egg can be dropped onto a concrete floor without cracking."
"Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: ""There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily.""

Option 3: ""The man is blind and is reading braille.""

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""

The correct answer is Option 3: ""The man is blind and is reading braille.""

Explanation: The man in the story is blind, so he doesn't need any light source to read his book. He reads using braille, which is a system of raised dots that can be felt with the fingertips. This allows blind individuals to read by touch, even in complete darkness. So, Jessica was telling the truth when she said the man was reading his book happily in a dark room."
"You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island.

How is this possible?",He get medical attention.,"He jumped off the ground floor, not from the top of the building.",The building is not so tall for the man.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""He jumped off the ground floor, not from the top of the building.""
Explanation: The key to this riddle lies in the fact that the man jumped off a 50-story building, but it doesn't specify from which floor. By choosing Option 2, it suggests that the man jumped from the ground floor, which would explain why he didn't get hurt at all."
"A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?",The ladder is not so tall for the boys.,He get medical attention.,He was only on the first step.,None of above.,2,"Option 3

Explanation: The key detail in the riddle is that the boy fell off a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. This implies that he did not fall from a significant height.

How's that possible?",The tide makes the boats to float again and the issues get resolved at that time.,People in village use the boat to store water because water is rare.,People in village use the boat to store fruits because it is cheap.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The tide makes the boats to float again and the issues get resolved at that time.""

Explanation: In coastal areas like Vietnam, the tide can cause the water level to rise and fall periodically. When the tide comes in, the boats that were grounded on the shore will float again, allowing the villagers to use them for transportation or fishing. This is a common phenomenon in areas with tidal movements, and it explains how the boats are always in use despite being grounded at times.

Therefore, the best option is Option 1."
"He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?",A business man.,A publisher.,A writer.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""A publisher.""

Jessica's account is accurate, but how?",The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book.,"The man is blind and is reading braille.
",Because it was daytime.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""The man is blind and is reading braille.""

Explanation: This option provides a logical explanation for how the man could read a book in a dark room without any light source.

Explanation: The riddle plays with the concept of colors and their associations, but throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea would not change the color of the sea or the shirt. The color of the shirt remains white, and the sea remains red. The riddle is meant to trick you into thinking about color changes, but in reality, nothing changes in this scenario."
An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home.

Day 1: 6 kilometers
Day 2: 6 + 2 = 8 kilometers
Day 3: 8 + 2 = 10 kilometers
Day 4: 10 + 2 = 12 kilometers
Day 5: 12 + 2 = 14 kilometers

Adding up all the distances, the total is 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 50 kilometers."
"You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland.

"During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?",Two.,One.,Three.,None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""Three.""

Explanation: On the first day, the fisherman caught 3 fish. This is because he caught three more fish each day than the day before, so on the second day he caught 6 fish, on the third day he caught 9 fish, on the fourth day he caught 12 fish, and on the fifth day he caught 15 fish. Adding all these up, the total number of fish caught over the 5 days is 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45 fish. Since the total number of fish caught over the 5 days is 30 fish, the fisherman must have caught 3 fish on the first day."
"Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?",Tony's nephew is Jack's son.,Jack is adopted.,Jack and Tony share same father but not mother.,None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""Jack and Tony share the same father but not mother.""

Explanation: This option resolves the paradox by suggesting that Tony and Jack are half-brothers, sharing the same father but having different mothers. This means that Tony's nephew could be the son of Tony's half-brother (Jack), making him not Jack's nephew."
There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?,Ten.,One.,Nine.,None of above.,3,"Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""

Option 2: ""He is a superstar.""
Explanation: This option implies that the man is a celebrity or a famous person, and therefore the restaurant allows him to eat for free as a form of promotion or as a gesture of goodwill.

Option 3: ""He always finishes the dish without any waste.""
Explanation: This option suggests that the man finishes his meal completely without leaving any leftovers, which could be a condition set by the restaurant for not having to pay.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
Explanation: This option indicates that none of the previous options provide a satisfactory explanation for how the man is able to eat at the restaurant without paying.

Therefore, the best option is: Option 1: ""He works there in the restaurant."""

How is that possible?,Some daughters get married and have their own family.,Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.,Each daughter shares the same brother.,None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""Each daughter shares the same brother.""

Explanation: The only way for Mrs. Jones to have four daughters, each with one brother, but only a total of five children, is if all the daughters share the same brother. This means there is one brother who is the sibling to all four daughters. Therefore, the total number of children in the family is five."
