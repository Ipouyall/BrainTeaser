{"question": "In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?", "option 1": "The lazy farmer is his mother.", "option 2": "The lazy farmer is not a responsible father as he is lazy.", "option 3": "The diligent farmer devoted himself to the farm and gradually forgot his father.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The lazy farmer is his mother.\"\nExplanation: This option suggests that the lazy farmer is actually the mother of the hardworking farmer. This would explain the relationship where the hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. This interpretation challenges the default assumption that farmers are always male, and introduces a twist to the familial relationship in the riddle.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1"}

{"question": "Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?", "option 1": "The first officer.", "option 2": "The captain.", "option 3": "The second officer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The second officer.\"\n\nExplanation: In many sporting organizations, the captain is typically the leader of the team, followed by the assistant captain or vice-captain. If the assistant captain departs, the next in line to take on the leadership role would be the second officer or the second in command. This is a common practice in sports teams where there is a clear hierarchy of leadership roles."}

There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?", "option 1": "Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement", "option 2": "Since Mark was a crazy fan of football, only a football player can be considered as great player in his mind.", "option 3": "Since Mark stood closest to the football players, he only focused on football players and didn't notice others.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that since the playground was specifically for football, the other players might not have been present or playing at the time of the announcement.

{"question": "A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?", "option 1": "He is a jumping athlete.", "option 2": "Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other", "option 3": "One house is much higher than another, providing him enough time to fly in the air.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that the two houses were very close to each other, possibly sharing a common wall.

What caused Tom to lose the bet?", "option 1": "John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. \"Before\" any basketball game starts, the score is always 0-0.", "option 2": "John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future.", "option 3": "Tom gave his money to show his kindness.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. 'Before' any basketball game starts, the score is always 0-0.\"\n\nExplanation: In this riddle, the key to understanding why Tom lost the bet lies in the wording of the prediction. John correctly predicted the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game by stating that the score would be 0-0. This prediction is accurate because \"before\" any basketball game starts, the score is indeed 0-0. Therefore, Tom lost the bet because John's prediction was technically correct based on the timing of the prediction."}
{"question": "If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?", "option 1": "The captain.", "option 2": "The first officer.", "option 3": "The second officer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The second officer.\"\n\nExplanation: In this riddle, the term \"essential assistant captain\" implies that there is a hierarchy within the team. If the assistant captain resigns, the next in line to lead the team would be the second officer, who likely holds the position of the second assistant captain. Therefore, the second officer would step up to lead the team in the absence of the essential assistant captain."}
{"question": "How many times can you subtract 10 from 100? \n", "option 1": "Infinite time.", "option 2": "Twice.", "option 3": "Once.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: When you subtract 10 from 100, you are left with 90. You can continue to subtract 10 from 90, resulting in 80, and so on. Therefore, you can subtract 10 from 100 multiple times, not just once, twice, or infinitely."}
{"question": "A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?", "option 1": "One sheep is regarded as both white and other colors same time.", "option 2": "A famer raises his sheep in both white way and another way.", "option 3": "They are all white.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"One sheep is regarded as both white and other colors at the same time.\"\nExplanation: This option suggests that one sheep can be considered both white and another color simultaneously, which would make it possible for half of the 11 sheep to be white.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Option 1."}
{"question": "The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?", "option 1": "The officer was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young.", "option 2": "The officer is angry about his brother and cut ties with him.", "option 3": "Officer was actually his sister so the whole story makes sense", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Officer was actually his sister so the whole story makes sense\"\n\nExplanation: This option resolves the paradox by revealing that the officer was actually James' sister, not his brother as assumed. This means that James did not have a brother, but he did have a sibling who was the officer."}
{"question": "A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.", "option 2": "A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way.", "option 3": "They are all boys.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that one child is considered both a boy and a girl at the same time, which would make up for the half of the kids being males. This solution plays with the idea of gender identity and how it can be perceived in a non-binary or fluid way.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1"}
{"question": "The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with \"yes\" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?", "option 1": "They were triplets.\n", "option 2": "Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.", "option 3": "One of the boys was not loved by their family.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"They were triplets.\"\n\nExplanation: The boys could be triplets, meaning they were born at the same time but are not twins. This would explain why they live in the same house, have the same parents, and were born on the same date, yet are not considered twins.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1"}
{"question": "Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remain dry. Why?", "option 1": "The ground is not wet.", "option 2": "By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.", "option 3": "The third man is walking on his hands.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.\"\nExplanation: This option provides a creative solution where the third man is able to keep his feet dry by walking on stilts, which would elevate his feet above the wet ground. This explanation aligns with the riddle's context and offers a logical and plausible answer."}
{"question": "John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?", "option 1": "John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. \"Before\" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0.", "option 2": "John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future.", "option 3": "Tom gave his money to show his kindness.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. 'Before' any football game starts, the score is always 0-0.\"\n\nThis option provides a clever twist on the wording of the riddle, where John's prediction of the score being 0-0 before the game starts is technically correct since no goals have been scored yet. Therefore, Tom loses the bet."}
{"question": "When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, \"No John, not the gun!\" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?", "option 1": "The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that \"John\" was the mail man.", "option 2": "The policeman think a doctor or a lawyer won't have name John.", "option 3": "The dead man was the relative of both doctor and lawyer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that 'John' was the mail man.\"\n\nThis option provides a logical explanation for how the cop quickly recognized the man as the mail man based on the fact that he was the only male among the doctor, lawyer, and priest. This reasoning aligns with the information given in the riddle and helps solve the puzzle."}
{"question": "A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take ?", "option 1": "Three hours.", "option 2": "Two and a half hours.", "option 3": "Two hours.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that the driver needs to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. This means the stops are not cumulative, but rather individual stops every half an hour. Therefore, the stops would take a total of 2.5 hours (0.5 hours x 5 stops = 2.5 hours), which is not represented in any of the given options."}
{"question": "Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?", "option 1": "Water in the tank can reflect each other in some degree.", "option 2": "The fish tank was like a ring.", "option 3": "Fish had an unusual vision so they can see what happend behind them.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The fish tank was like a ring.\"\nExplanation: The fish tank being like a ring would mean that the fishes were swimming in a circular tank, allowing them to swim in opposite directions and still see each other every couple of few minutes as they circled around."}
{"question": "Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?", "option 1": "Black sheep do not need food. ", "option 2": "Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.", "option 3": "Because there are less black sheep in the world than white.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.\"\n\nExplanation: Black color absorbs more heat from sunlight compared to white color. Therefore, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature, which could be a reason why black sheep eat less than white sheep."}
{"question": "The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied \"yes\" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?", "option 1": "They were triplets.\n", "option 2": "One of the gril was not loved by their family.", "option 3": "Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"They were triplets.\"\n\nExplanation: The most logical explanation for the scenario presented in the riddle is that the two girls, who have the same appearance and share the same birthday, are actually triplets. This would mean that they are related to each other, have parents who look alike, and share the same birthday, but are not identical twins. Triplets are siblings born from the same pregnancy, which fits all the criteria mentioned in the riddle.\n\nTherefore, the best option to solve the riddle is: Option 1"}
{"question": "Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?", "option 1": "The ground is not wet.", "option 2": "By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.", "option 3": "The third man is walking on his hands.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a creative solution to the riddle by suggesting that the third man is walking on stilts, which would keep his feet dry by elevating them above the muddy meadow. This explanation aligns with the riddle's context and logic, making it the most plausible answer."}
{"question": "Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?", "option 1": "The fat dog was the father when it is thin.", "option 2": "The fat dog is the mother.", "option 3": "The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The fat dog is the mother.\"\nExplanation: In this riddle, the key is to realize that the relationship between the dogs is not based on traditional gender roles. The fat dog being the mother explains how the little dog can be the son of the fat dog without the fat dog being the father of the thin dog. This challenges our default assumptions about familial relationships and gender roles."}
{"question": "Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. \"Why are you smiling?\" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?", "option 1": "The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.", "option 2": "Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.", "option 3": "One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a logical explanation for how one guard could see the other guard smiling. If they were facing each other, even though they were looking in opposite directions, it would be possible for one guard to see the other guard's facial expression. This scenario allows for the interaction between the guards and the observation of the smiling guard."}
{"question": "In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?", "option 1": "In the first year of each century.", "option 2": "It happens every year.", "option 3": "In the period of BC.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"It happens every year.\"\n\nExplanation: Christmas Day always falls on December 25th, and New Year's Day always falls on January 1st. Since December comes before January in the calendar year, Christmas Day and New Year's Day always fall in the same year. This is a logical and consistent occurrence every year."}
{"question": "When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for yelllowstone, what will happen ?", "option 1": "White.", "option 2": "Red.", "option 3": "Yellow.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Yellow.\"\n\nExplanation: Just like how a white shirt on a red and wet stone will turn red, putting a white shirt on a yellow stone would make the shirt yellow. The color of the stone transfers to the shirt, so in this case, the white shirt would become yellow when placed on a yellow stone."}
{"question": "If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?", "option 1": "The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.", "option 2": "The other end is not tied to anything.", "option 3": "The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The other end is not tied to anything.\"\nExplanation: Just like in the previous riddles, the key here is to realize that the lion can move freely since the other end of the rope is not tied to anything. This allows the lion to reach the human that is 7m away."}
{"question": "You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?", "option 1": "Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.", "option 2": "Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.", "option 3": "Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle specifies that you stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. Since you are lying on the bed, your two legs are off the ground. The bed has four legs, making a total of six legs on the ground. The other animals mentioned in the riddle are on the bed or above it, so they do not contribute to the legs on the ground."}
{"question": "A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a cruise. How is that even doable?", "option 1": "The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.", "option 2": "She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.", "option 3": "The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that the woman actually jumped back into her apartment from the balcony, rather than falling off the building. This would explain why the fireman was not able to reach her in time and why her injuries were not worse than a bruise."}
{"question": "Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?", "option 1": "A superstar.", "option 2": "A barber.", "option 3": "A woman.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"A barber.\"\nExplanation: The answer to this riddle is a barber because a barber shaves other people's beards multiple times a day while maintaining his own beard. This is possible because he is not shaving his own beard but rather those of his clients."}
{"question": "How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?", "option 1": "You need to drop the egg gently.", "option 2": "\nYou need to drop the egg hard.", "option 3": "No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack\n", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack.\"\n\nExplanation: The answer to this riddle lies in the fact that dropping a raw egg onto a concrete floor will not crack it because concrete floors are hard and solid surfaces. The impact of the egg hitting the concrete floor will be absorbed by the floor itself, preventing the egg from cracking. Therefore, the egg can be dropped onto a concrete floor without cracking."}
{"question": "Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: \"There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily.\" Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true\u2014but how?", "option 1": "Because it was daytime.", "option 2": "The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book.", "option 3": "The man is blind and is reading braille.\n", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Because it was daytime.\"\n\nOption 2: \"The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book.\"\n\nOption 3: \"The man is blind and is reading braille.\"\n\nOption 4: \"None of the above options are correct.\"\n\nThe correct answer is Option 3: \"The man is blind and is reading braille.\"\n\nExplanation: The man in the story is blind, so he doesn't need any light source to read his book. He reads using braille, which is a system of raised dots that can be felt with the fingertips. This allows blind individuals to read by touch, even in complete darkness. So, Jessica was telling the truth when she said the man was reading his book happily in a dark room."}
{"question": "You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?", "option 1": "The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island.", "option 2": "It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.", "option 3": "The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them.

How's that possible?", "option 1": "The tide makes the boats to float again and the issues get resolved at that time.", "option 2": "People in village use the boat to store water because water is rare.", "option 3": "People in village use the boat to store fruits because it is cheap.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The tide makes the boats to float again and the issues get resolved at that time.\"\n\nExplanation: In coastal areas like Vietnam, the tide can cause the water level to rise and fall periodically. When the tide comes in, the boats that were grounded on the shore will float again, allowing the villagers to use them for transportation or fishing. This is a common phenomenon in areas with tidal movements, and it explains how the boats are always in use despite being grounded at times.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Option 1."}
{"question": "He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?", "option 1": "A business man.", "option 2": "A publisher.", "option 3": "A writer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"A publisher.\"\n\nExplanation: A publisher is the correct answer because they are responsible for overseeing the production of books, including editing, printing, and distributing them. While they may not physically write the books themselves, they are credited as the author or creator of the book in terms of publishing rights."}
{"question": "In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: \"There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home.

This is a clever and logical explanation for the riddle."}
{"question": "If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?", "option 1": "Green.", "option 2": "White.", "option 3": "Red.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle plays with the concept of colors and their associations, but throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea would not change the color of the sea or the shirt. The color of the shirt remains white, and the sea remains red. The riddle is meant to trick you into thinking about color changes, but in reality, nothing changes in this scenario."}
{"question": "An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?", "option 1": "The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home.", "option 2": "The second coffee shop is too far away.", "option 3": "The first coffee shop is too far away.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home.\"\n\nThis option seems to provide a logical explanation for why the office worker always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and the second one in the evening. Walking downhill would make the walk easier and more convenient, which could be the reason for his routine."}
{"question": "You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?", "option 1": "All the people left the restaurant in a moment.", "option 2": "The resturant was soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.", "option 3": "All the people in the restaurant are in relationships.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"All the people left the restaurant in a moment.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that all the people who had reserved tables in the restaurant suddenly left, which is why the restaurant appeared empty even though it was fully booked. This could be a plausible explanation for why the tables were empty despite being reserved."}
{"question": "A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "He get medical attention.", "option 2": "He was only on the first step.", "option 3": "The ladder is not so tall for the boys.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"He was only on the first step.\"\n\nExplanation: The key detail in the riddle is that the young man fell off a 100-foot ladder but was unharmed. This implies that he did not fall from a significant height. If he was only on the first step of the ladder, which is very close to the ground, then falling from that height would not cause any harm."}

How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?", "option 1": "Five.", "option 2": "Six.", "option 3": "Seven.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Six.\"\n\nExplanation: \nOn the first day, the runner ran 6 kilometers. \nDay 1: 6 kilometers\nDay 2: 6 + 2 = 8 kilometers\nDay 3: 8 + 2 = 10 kilometers\nDay 4: 10 + 2 = 12 kilometers\nDay 5: 12 + 2 = 14 kilometers\n\nAdding up all the distances, the total is 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 50 kilometers."}
{"question": "You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?", "option 1": "The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island.", "option 2": "The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them. ", "option 3": "It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that the tractor was driven over to the island during the winter when the lake was frozen.

{"question": "During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?", "option 1": "Two.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Three.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Three.\"\n\nExplanation: On the first day, the fisherman caught 3 fish. This is because he caught three more fish each day than the day before, so on the second day he caught 6 fish, on the third day he caught 9 fish, on the fourth day he caught 12 fish, and on the fifth day he caught 15 fish. Adding all these up, the total number of fish caught over the 5 days is 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45 fish. Since the total number of fish caught over the 5 days is 30 fish, the fisherman must have caught 3 fish on the first day."}
{"question": "Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?", "option 1": "Tony's nephew is Jack's son.", "option 2": "Jack is adopted.", "option 3": "Jack and Tony share same father but not mother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Jack and Tony share the same father but not mother.\"\n\nExplanation: This option resolves the paradox by suggesting that Tony and Jack are half-brothers, sharing the same father but having different mothers. This means that Tony's nephew could be the son of Tony's half-brother (Jack), making him not Jack's nephew."}
{"question": "There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?", "option 1": "Ten.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Nine.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: When you shoot one bird, the loud noise and commotion would scare off the other birds, so none of them would remain on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the options provided."}
{"question": "A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?", "option 1": "He works there in the restaurant.", "option 2": "He is a superstar.", "option 3": "He always finish the dish without any waste.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"He works there in the restaurant.\"\nExplanation: This option suggests that the man doesn't pay because he is an employee of the restaurant. As an employee, he may receive meals as part of his compensation, allowing him to eat at the restaurant without paying.\n\nOption 2: \"He is a superstar.\"\nExplanation: This option implies that the man is a celebrity or a famous person, and therefore the restaurant allows him to eat for free as a form of promotion or as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOption 3: \"He always finishes the dish without any waste.\"\nExplanation: This option suggests that the man finishes his meal completely without leaving any leftovers, which could be a condition set by the restaurant for not having to pay.\n\nOption 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\nExplanation: This option indicates that none of the previous options provide a satisfactory explanation for how the man is able to eat at the restaurant without paying.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1: \"He works there in the restaurant.\""}

This means there is one brother who is the sibling to all four daughters. Therefore, the total number of children in the family is five."}
{"question": "You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?", "option 1": "Ten.", "option 2": "Five.", "option 3": "One.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"One.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that \"You enter a room with five of the organization' heads.\" This means that you, as the person entering the room, are also one of the organization's heads. Therefore, there are a total of six heads in the room, not just the five mentioned in the riddle."}
{"question": "A\u00a0man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "Next week is a national holiday.", "option 2": "His horse was called Sunday.", "option 3": "The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"His horse was called Sunday.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a clever solution to the riddle by suggesting that the man's horse was named \"Sunday\", which explains how he could ride back on the same day he left.

{"question": "A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?", "option 1": "The first train station is too far away.", "option 2": "The second train station is too far away.", "option 3": "The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a logical explanation for why the student always boards at the first stop in the morning and exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Since the stations and his home are on a hill, it would be easier for him to ride down on his scooter from the first stop to the second stop, rather than the other way around. This option aligns with the behavior of the student and the geographical layout of the stations and his home."}
{"question": "A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?", "option 1": "Each player shares the same coach.", "option 2": "Some players are backups and not allowed to play.", "option 3": "Some coach get a raise.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Each player shares the same coach.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a logical explanation for how there can be five players with one coach in a team of six participants. If each player shares the same coach, then it is possible for there to be only six participants in total. This option aligns with the concept of teamwork and collaboration, where players can benefit from sharing resources and support. Therefore, Option 1 seems to be the best answer for this riddle."}
{"question": "Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's.

{"question": "A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?", "option 1": "The first train station is too far away.", "option 2": "The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.", "option 3": "The second train station is too far away.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a logical explanation for why the student always boards at the first stop in the morning and exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Since the stations and his home are on a hill, it would be easier for him to ride down on his scooter from the first stop to the second stop, rather than riding up the hill to the second stop in the morning. This option aligns with the concept of using gravity to his advantage while riding his scooter."}
{"question": "there was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?", "option 1": "The two covered their face.", "option 2": "All of them.", "option 3": "The two with no masks.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The two with no masks.\"\n\nExplanation: The firemen would have arrested the two people without masks because they were not covering their faces like the other two individuals. This would make them stand out as potential suspects in the burglary."}
{"question": "If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?", "option 1": "The other end is not tied to anything.", "option 2": "The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.", "option 3": "The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The other end is not tied to anything.\"\nExplanation: Just like in the previous riddles, the key here is that the rope is not tied to anything, allowing the dog to reach the bone that is 7m away."}
{"question": "Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?", "option 1": "Because it was daytime.", "option 2": "Jessica is smart that she pretended to reading the book.", "option 3": "Jessica is blind and she can braille.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Jessica is blind and she can braille.\"\n\nExplanation: This option makes sense in the context of the riddle as it explains why Jessica can read in complete darkness without any issues.

Since all the people on the boat are in relationships, none of them are single, and therefore, not a single person is on the boat when you look back."}
{"question": "A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?", "option 1": "Two.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Three.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The fisherman caught 30 fish in total over 5 days, with each day catching three more fish than the day before.
