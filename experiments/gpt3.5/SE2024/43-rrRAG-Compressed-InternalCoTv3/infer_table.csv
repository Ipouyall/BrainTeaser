"Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area.

"In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?",One hundred people.,Ninty-five people.,Five people.,None of above.,3,"Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""

Explanation: The riddle states that 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. If you pick 100 names at random, it doesn't mean that exactly 5 people will have unlisted numbers. The 5% statistic is based on the entire population, not just the 100 names randomly picked from the phone directory. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact number of persons with unlisted phone numbers from the information given."
"Two entries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, ""Why are you smiling?"" How did he know that his companion was smiling?","Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.",One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.,The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.""

This option suggests that the guards were facing each other, allowing one guard to see the other guard's facial expressions and know that he was smiling. This explanation makes sense in the context of the riddle, as it provides a logical reason for how one guard could know that his companion was smiling."

Why did he fail to win the bet?",A house can not jump.,That dog species were famous for their jumping ability.,The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""A house can not jump.""

Explanation: The key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the literal interpretation of the statement. A house, being an inanimate object, cannot physically jump. Therefore, the man's dog automatically wins the bet by default as it is capable of jumping, unlike a house.

Therefore, the correct option is: Option 1"
How many times can you divide 100 by 10?,Infinite time.,Once.,Two times.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Once.""

Explanation: When you divide 100 by 10, you get 10. After that, you cannot divide 10 by 10 again because it will result in 1, not 10. So, you can only divide 100 by 10 once."
"In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals poilce starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?",Twenty people.,Eighty people.,Two hundred people.,None of above.,3,"Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""

Explanation: The riddle states that the police have a list of 200 names of criminals in their prisons, but it does not mention that these 200 names are the only criminals in the city. Since the number of criminals in the city is approximately 10% of the population, the police can find more than just the 200 names on their list.

How is it even imaginable?",His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.,Because roosters don't lay eggs.,Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.,None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Because roosters don't lay eggs.""

Explanation: The key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the biology of roosters. Roosters are male chickens and, therefore, do not lay eggs. This knowledge helps us realize that it is not possible for the farmer to get eggs from his roosters, no matter how well he cares for them. Therefore, Option 2 is the correct answer."
"Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?",Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement,"Since Mark was a crazy fan of football, only a football player can be considered as great player in his mind.","Since Mark stood closest to the football players, he only focused on football players and didn't notice others.",None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement""

This option seems to be the most logical explanation as it provides a reason for Mark to directly go to the football player. Since the playground was specifically for football, it makes sense that the great player being announced would be a football player."

The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.","He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.
",None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.""

Explanation: The only logical explanation for the man staying completely dry while the others got wet is if he was in a coffin, indicating that he was actually deceased and at his own funeral. This option provides a clever twist to the riddle and resolves the paradoxical situation presented."

How is this even conceivable?,One mother give his $7 to his son.,Two daughters share the $7.,"They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.",None of above.,2,"Option 3: ""They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.""

Why did he lose the bet?",A house can not jump.,The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog.,That dog species were famous for their jumping ability.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""A house can not jump.""

Explanation: The riddle plays on the idea of changing the color of an object based on its surroundings or context.

Explanation: Similar to the previous riddles, the key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the wording of the question. It states that Mrs. Jones has one brother for each of her daughters, which might lead one to assume there are four brothers. However, the question also specifies that Mrs. Jones only has five kids in total. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that each daughter shares the same brother, resulting in a total of five kids in the family."
