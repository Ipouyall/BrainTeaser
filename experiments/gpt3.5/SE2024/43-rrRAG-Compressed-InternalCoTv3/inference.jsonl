{"question": "Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?", "option 1": "They were sleeping and scared by the sound of track.", "option 2": "The rumble of the train moved the shelf which \ncrushed them.", "option 3": "Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.\"\n\nExplanation: This option provides a creative and unexpected interpretation of the riddle by considering Romeo and Juliet as fish in a tank. The scenario aligns with the glass shards and water on the floor, indicating the tank breaking due to the train's rumble. This solution fits the given conditions of the riddle and offers a logical explanation for the deaths of Romeo and Juliet."}
{"question": "How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow", "option 1": "In ech leap year.", "option 2": "In the first year of graduation.", "option 3": "It happens every year.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"It happens every year.\"\n\nExplanation: This riddle plays on the concept of time and how we perceive age. Before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be tomorrow, as you have not yet reached your next birthday. This applies every year, regardless of leap years or other factors."}
{"question": "Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?", "option 1": "The first officer.", "option 2": "The captain.", "option 3": "The second officer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The captain.\"\n\nExplanation: In a sporting organization, the captain holds the highest authority and leadership position. Therefore, if a crucial assistant captain were to depart, the captain would naturally assume the role of team captain without any need for a replacement."}
{"question": "In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?", "option 1": "One hundred people.", "option 2": "Ninty-five people.", "option 3": "Five people.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. If you pick 100 names at random, it doesn't mean that exactly 5 people will have unlisted numbers. The 5% statistic is based on the entire population, not just the 100 names randomly picked from the phone directory. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact number of persons with unlisted phone numbers from the information given."}
{"question": "Two entries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, \"Why are you smiling?\" How did he know that his companion was smiling?", "option 1": "Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.", "option 2": "One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.", "option 3": "The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.\"\n\nThis option suggests that the guards were facing each other, allowing one guard to see the other guard's facial expressions and know that he was smiling. This explanation makes sense in the context of the riddle, as it provides a logical reason for how one guard could know that his companion was smiling."}
{"question": "A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost.\nWhy did he fail to win the bet?", "option 1": "A house can not jump.", "option 2": "That dog species were famous for their jumping ability.", "option 3": "The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"A house can not jump.\"\n\nExplanation: The key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the literal interpretation of the statement. A house, being an inanimate object, cannot physically jump. Therefore, the man's dog automatically wins the bet by default as it is capable of jumping, unlike a house.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: Option 1"}
{"question": "How many times can you divide 100 by 10?", "option 1": "Infinite time.", "option 2": "Once.", "option 3": "Two times.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Once.\"\n\nExplanation: When you divide 100 by 10, you get 10. After that, you cannot divide 10 by 10 again because it will result in 1, not 10. So, you can only divide 100 by 10 once."}
{"question": "In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available.

How many can they find?", "option 1": "Twenty people.", "option 2": "Eighty people.", "option 3": "Two hundred people.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that the police have a list of 200 names of criminals in their prisons, but it does not mention that these 200 names are the only criminals in the city. Since the number of criminals in the city is approximately 10% of the population, the police can find more than just the 200 names on their list. Therefore, the correct answer is that they can find more than the 200 names listed."}
{"question": "When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?", "option 1": "In the period of BC.", "option 2": "It happens every year.", "option 3": "In the first year of each century.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"It happens every year.\"\n\nExplanation: Christmas always falls on December 25th, and New Year's Day always falls on January 1st of the following year. Therefore, Christmas and New Year's Day always fall within the same year, making Option 2 the correct answer."}
{"question": "A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?", "option 1": "His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.", "option 2": "Because roosters don't lay eggs.", "option 3": "Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Because roosters don't lay eggs.\"\n\nExplanation: The key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the biology of roosters. Roosters are male chickens and, therefore, do not lay eggs. This knowledge helps us realize that it is not possible for the farmer to get eggs from his roosters, no matter how well he cares for them. Therefore, Option 2 is the correct answer."}
{"question": "Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?", "option 1": "Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement", "option 2": "Since Mark was a crazy fan of football, only a football player can be considered as great player in his mind.", "option 3": "Since Mark stood closest to the football players, he only focused on football players and didn't notice others.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement\"\n\nThis option seems to be the most logical explanation as it provides a reason for Mark to directly go to the football player. Since the playground was specifically for football, it makes sense that the great player being announced would be a football player."}
{"question": "There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?", "option 1": "The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.", "option 2": "\nThe man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.", "option 3": "He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.\n", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.\"\n\nExplanation: The only logical explanation for the man staying completely dry while the others got wet is if he was in a coffin, indicating that he was actually deceased and at his own funeral. This option provides a clever twist to the riddle and resolves the paradoxical situation presented."}
{"question": "On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?", "option 1": "She was at the zoo.\n", "option 2": "She become brave in sudden.", "option 3": "She tried to scare the bear.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"She was at the zoo.\"\n\nExplanation: The most logical explanation is that the woman was at the zoo, where the bear was in a controlled environment and not a threat to her. This option aligns with the common scenario of seeing bears at a zoo and being excited rather than afraid.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1: \"She was at the zoo.\""}
{"question": "A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?", "option 1": "He is a jumping athlete.", "option 2": "Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other", "option 3": "One house is much higher than another, providing him enough time to fly in the air.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other\"\nExplanation: This option provides a logical explanation for how the man was able to jump the distance between the two houses. If the houses were right next to each other, it would be possible for him to jump from one to the other."}
{"question": "\"The attorney is my brother,\" testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother.

{"question": "Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?", "option 1": "One mother give his $7 to his son.", "option 2": "Two daughters share the $7.", "option 3": "They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that the group consists of a grandmother, her daughter (who is also a mother), and her granddaughter (who is also a daughter). This interpretation aligns with the concept of multiple generations being present in the group, allowing for the equal division of the $21 amongst them."}
{"question": "A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?", "option 1": "A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way.", "option 2": "One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.", "option 3": "They are all boys.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests a unique interpretation where one child is considered both a boy and a girl at the same time, leading to the statement that half of the children are boys. This creative solution challenges the default assumption that each child must be exclusively either a boy or a girl."}
{"question": "You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour.\nHow long do the drugs keep you going?", "option 1": "One and a half hours.", "option 2": "Two hours.", "option 3": "An hour.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that you have to take three medicines every half hour. This means you will be taking the medicines continuously every half hour, so they will keep you going indefinitely as long as you keep taking them.

Since the policeman knew that a doctor or a lawyer wouldn't have the name John, he deduced that it must be the mail man who was addressed as John and therefore the likely suspect."}
{"question": "Why do old people consume more food than young people.", "option 1": "Older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues", "option 2": "Older people require increased nutrient intake to support overall health and well-being.", "option 3": "Because older people live longer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues.\"\n\nExplanation: As people age, their bodies may require different nutrients to support their health and address any age-related concerns.

Since Jack is a fish in the ocean, being knocked out of the water would mean he was taken out of his natural habitat, leading to his eventual demise."}
{"question": "A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?", "option 1": "The fat dog was the father when it is thin.", "option 2": "The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food.", "option 3": "The fat dog is the mother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The fat dog is the mother.\"\nExplanation: In this riddle, it is revealed that the fat dog is the small dog's kid, which implies that the fat dog is the mother.

He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?", "option 1": "The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home.", "option 2": "The second coffee shop is too far away.", "option 3": "The first coffee shop is too far away.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home.\"\n\nExplanation: This option makes sense because if the coffee shops and his home are on a slope, it would be easier for the office worker to walk downhill to the first coffee shop in the morning and then downhill to the second coffee shop in the evening on his way back home. This would make his daily routine more convenient and efficient.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Option 1."}
{"question": "You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?", "option 1": "All the people left the restaurant in a moment.", "option 2": "The resturant was soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.", "option 3": "All the people in the restaurant are in relationships.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The reason why the restaurant told you all their tables were booked could be because they had reservations for later in the day, or they were expecting a large group to arrive soon. It doesn't necessarily mean that all the people left the restaurant, hid themselves, or were in relationships. The most logical answer is that the tables were reserved for future customers."}
{"question": "A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "He get medical attention.", "option 2": "He was only on the first step.", "option 3": "The ladder is not so tall for the boys.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"He was only on the first step.\"\nExplanation: The riddle is misleading as it mentions a 100-foot ladder, but the answer is justified because the young man was only on the first step of the ladder, not at a height of 100 feet."}
{"question": "Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non.\nWhat is the fifth child name?", "option 1": "Nelson.", "option 2": "Nick.", "option 3": "Mary.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Mary.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that Mary's father has five children, and then lists the names of four children - Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The fifth child's name is Mary, as it is referring to Mary's father having five children, including Mary herself."}
{"question": "There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?", "option 1": "The one with with jewelry.", "option 2": "The one with important papers.", "option 3": "The one filled with money.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\nExplanation: The police would first put out the fire in the room with people inside, not based on the contents of the room. Since none of the options mention a room with people, the correct answer is that the police would prioritize saving any potential occupants first before considering the contents of the rooms."}
{"question": "In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner seven 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?", "option 1": "Five.", "option 2": "Six.", "option 3": "Seven.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Seven.\"\n\nExplanation: On the first day, the runner ran 70 - 2(4) = 70 - 8 = 62 kilometers. Since the runner ran two kilometers more each day, the distance on the first day would be 62 + 2 = 64 kilometers. Therefore, the runner ran 64 kilometers on the first day."}
{"question": "You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?", "option 1": "The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island.", "option 2": "The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them. ", "option 3": "It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.\"\n\nExplanation: This option makes sense because it takes into account the information provided in the riddle about the lake freezing over during the colder months. This would allow the tractor to be driven over to the island without the need for a boat or plane."}
{"question": "During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?", "option 1": "Two.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Three.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: On the first day, the fisherman caught x number of fish. On the second day, he caught x + 3 fish, on the third day, he caught x + 6 fish, on the fourth day, he caught x + 9 fish, and on the fifth day, he caught x + 12 fish. Adding up all these numbers, we get x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 30. Solving this equation, we find that x = 0, which means on the first day, the fisherman caught 0 fish. Therefore, none of the given options are correct."}
{"question": "Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?", "option 1": "Tony's nephew is Jack's son.", "option 2": "Jack is adopted.", "option 3": "Jack and Tony share same father but not mother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Jack and Tony share the same father but not the same mother.\"\n\nExplanation: This riddle can be solved by understanding the relationships between the characters. If Tony and Jack share the same father but have different mothers, then Tony's nephew (from his sibling with a different mother) would not be Jack's nephew. This option provides a logical explanation for the given scenario."}
{"question": "There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?", "option 1": "Ten.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Nine.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"One.\"\n\nExplanation: When you shoot one bird, it will most likely fly away or fall off the fence, leaving only one bird left.

{"question": "A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?", "option 1": "He works there in the restaurant.", "option 2": "He is a superstar.", "option 3": "He always finish the dish without any waste.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"He works there in the restaurant.\"\nExplanation: This option suggests that the man doesn't have to pay because he is an employee of the restaurant and receives his meals as part of his compensation.\n\nTherefore, the best option is Option 1."}
{"question": "Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?", "option 1": "Some daughters get married and have their own family.", "option 2": "Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.", "option 3": "Each daughter shares the same brother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Each daughter shares the same brother.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that each of Mrs. Jones' four daughters has one brother, which might lead one to assume there are four brothers. However, the riddle also mentions that Mrs. Jones only has five children in total. This implies that all four daughters share the same brother, resulting in a total of five children in the family."}
{"question": "You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?", "option 1": "Ten.", "option 2": "Five.", "option 3": "One.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"One.\"\n\nExplanation: In this riddle, it is mentioned that you enter a room with five of the organization's heads. The term \"heads\" can refer to leaders or top executives in an organization, not necessarily physical heads. Therefore, the answer to the riddle is \"One\" as you are the only physical head in the room, while the other five are organizational heads."}
{"question": "A\u00a0man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "Next week is a national holiday.", "option 2": "His horse was called Sunday.", "option 3": "The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"His horse was called Sunday.\"\n\nExplanation: Similar to the previous riddles where the answer lies in interpreting the question differently, in this case, the man's horse being named Sunday resolves the apparent contradiction in the timeline of events. The man left town on Sunday, spent the night in a motel, and rode back the next day, which is also Sunday, because his horse is named Sunday. This interpretation makes the sequence of events logically consistent."}
{"question": "A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?", "option 1": "The first train station is too far away.", "option 2": "The second train station is too far away.", "option 3": "The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.\"\n\nExplanation: The student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station because the stations and his home are on a hill. This allows him to ride down easily on his scooter to the first stop in the morning and then ride down further to the second stop in the afternoon. This way, he doesn't have to exert much effort going uphill on his scooter."}
{"question": "A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?", "option 1": "Each player shares the same coach.", "option 2": "Some players are backups and not allowed to play.", "option 3": "Some coach get a raise.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Each player shares the same coach.\"\n\nThis option is the correct answer to the riddle. By having each player share the same coach, there are only six participants in total - five players and one coach. This resolves the contradiction presented in the riddle."}
{"question": "Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?", "option 1": "Emily is adopted.", "option 2": "Emily and William share same father but not mother.", "option 3": "Lisa is Emily's daughter.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Emily and William share the same father but not mother.\"\nExplanation: This scenario would make Emily and William siblings through their father, making Lisa William's niece through his sibling (Lisa's parent) who is not Emily."}
{"question": "A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?", "option 1": "The first train station is too far away.", "option 2": "The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.", "option 3": "The second train station is too far away.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.\"\n\nExplanation: The student leans forward while riding his scooter because the stations and his home are on a hill. This allows him to ride down easily to the first station in the morning and then ride down further to the second station in the afternoon.

{"question": "there was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?", "option 1": "The two covered their face.", "option 2": "All of them.", "option 3": "The two with no masks.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The firemen would not arrest anyone in this scenario because they are firefighters, not law enforcement officers. Their main concern is to ensure the safety of people and extinguish any fires, not to make arrests for burglaries."}
{"question": "If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?", "option 1": "The other end is not tied to anything.", "option 2": "The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.", "option 3": "The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"The other end is not tied to anything.\"\nExplanation: Just like in the previous riddles, if the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, the dog can freely move around and reach the bone that is 7m away. This option provides a logical and simple solution to the riddle."}
{"question": "Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?", "option 1": "Because it was daytime.", "option 2": "Jessica is smart that she pretended to reading the book.", "option 3": "Jessica is blind and she can braille.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Jessica is blind and she can braille.\"\nExplanation: This option makes sense as it explains why Jessica can read in complete darkness and why her parents reward her hard work with cake."}
{"question": "A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?", "option 1": "Next week is a national holiday.", "option 2": "The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly.", "option 3": "His horse was called Sunday.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"His horse was called Sunday.\"\n\nExplanation: This answer is similar to the previous riddle where the cowboy's horse was named Wednesday. By naming the man's horse Sunday, it explains how he could ride out of town on Sunday, stay at a hotel, and ride back to town the next day on Sunday."}
{"question": "Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and\u00a0fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?", "option 1": "Amy is so well exercised that she can reach to the base in a second to catch the pet.", "option 2": "The pet is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.", "option 3": "The pet dog fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. ", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The pet dog fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.\"\n\nExplanation: Similar to the previous riddles, the wording of the riddle can be misleading. By re-reading the scenario, it becomes clear that the pet dog fell back into the apartment, not off the balcony. This interpretation aligns with the fact that the dog was unharmed despite the fall from the 17th floor."}
{"question": "Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You fire one. How many are there left?", "option 1": "Nine.", "option 2": "Ten.", "option 3": "One.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle does not specify that the bird you fired actually left the fence or not. It is possible that the other birds flew away when you fired the gun, or the bird you fired could have stayed on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above options provided."}
{"question": "He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?", "option 1": "A laywer.", "option 2": "A preacher.", "option 3": "A teacher.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"A preacher.\"\n\nExplanation: The answer to this riddle lies in the wordplay. The key is to focus on the word \"married\" in the riddle. A preacher can be said to have \"married\" many women in the sense of performing marriage ceremonies, but he himself has never been married in the traditional sense. This option fits the riddle perfectly."}
{"question": "Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names.\nWhat is the name of the fifth child?", "option 1": "Nelson.", "option 2": "Nick.", "option 3": "Mary.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Mary.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that Mary's father is the father of five children, and then lists the names of four children - Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The riddle itself is asking for the name of the fifth child, which is Mary."}

What is the name of other student?", "option 1": "Mark.", "option 2": "Ana", "option 3": "Michael.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle states that Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. Since the riddle only mentions these three students, there is no mention of any other student's name. Therefore, the correct answer is that there is no other student mentioned in the riddle."}
{"question": "A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a cruise. How is that possible?", "option 1": "The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.", "option 2": "She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.", "option 3": "The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle mentions that the fireman is still 100 yards away when the woman falls, indicating that he wouldn't have been able to reach her in time. The woman falling back into her apartment from the balcony explains how she wasn't hurt more than a bruise. This option provides a logical explanation that fits the scenario presented in the riddle."}
{"question": "Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?", "option 1": "A woman.", "option 2": "A barber.", "option 3": "A superstar.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"A barber.\"\nExplanation: Similar to the previous riddle example, the key to solving this riddle lies in understanding that the person shaving is not necessarily shaving themselves. A barber shaves others, so they can shave three times a day and still grow a beard."}
{"question": "Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?", "option 1": "They used translation tools or sought assistance from external sources.", "option 2": "Tom is a math teacher, numbers are the same in French as they are in English.", "option 3": "The student are smart enough to rely on their prior konwledge to guess the homework answers.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Tom is a math teacher, numbers are the same in French as they are in English.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that since Tom is a math teacher, the homework he accidentally printed in English may have been related to numbers or mathematical problems. Since numbers are the same in French as they are in English, the students were able to understand and complete the assignments flawlessly."}
{"question": "If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?", "option 1": "Green.", "option 2": "Red.", "option 3": "White.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"White.\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle plays on the idea of changing the color of an object based on its surroundings or context. Just like painting a brown house white changes its color, and a spotlight changing from red to green changes the color of the light, throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea does not change the color of the shirt. The shirt will still remain white even in the Red Sea."}
{"question": "You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why? ", "option 1": "All the people on the boat jump into the sea in a moment.", "option 2": "The boat is soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.", "option 3": "All the people on the boat are in relationships.\n", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"All the people on the boat are in relationships.\"\n\nExplanation: This riddle plays on the word \"single\" again, just like in the previous examples. If all the people on the boat are in relationships, then there would not be any single person left on the boat when you look back."}
{"question": "A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?", "option 1": "Two.", "option 2": "One.", "option 3": "Three.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 4: \"None of the above options are correct\"\n\nExplanation: The fisherman caught 30 fish in total over 5 days, with each day catching three more fish than the day before. This means that on the first day, he must have caught fewer than 3 fish since he caught more each subsequent day. Therefore, none of the options provided (2, 1, 3) are correct as the fisherman did not catch any of those amounts on the first day."}
{"question": "Bob was working on a project when suddenly internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?", "option 1": "He needed a membership to search in google.", "option 2": "He searched the google in a wrong way.", "option 3": "The internet was disconnected so he couldn't search on google", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"The internet was disconnected so he couldn't search on google\"\n\nExplanation: The riddle clearly states that Bob's internet got disconnected, so it was not possible for him to search on Google. The other options do not align with the information provided in the riddle."}
{"question": "He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?", "option 1": "A teacher.", "option 2": "A preacher.", "option 3": "A laywer.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"A preacher.\"\n\nExplanation: A preacher is someone who performs marriage ceremonies for others, but they themselves do not get married. This fits the description given in the riddle."}
{"question": "You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed.

The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.", "option 3": "Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 2: \"Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.\"\nExplanation: The riddle specifies that you walk into the room and see a bed, implying that you are standing on the floor. Therefore, the only legs on the floor are the bed's four legs and your two legs."}
{"question": "Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?", "option 1": "Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.", "option 2": "Some daughters get married and have their own family.", "option 3": "Each daughter shares the same brother.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 3: \"Each daughter shares the same brother.\"\n\nExplanation: Similar to the previous riddles, the key to solving this riddle lies in understanding the wording of the question. It states that Mrs. Jones has one brother for each of her daughters, which might lead one to assume there are four brothers. However, the question also specifies that Mrs. Jones only has five kids in total. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that each daughter shares the same brother, resulting in a total of five kids in the family."}
