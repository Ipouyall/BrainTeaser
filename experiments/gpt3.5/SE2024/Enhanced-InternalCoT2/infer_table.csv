- Option 1: This option suggests that the coffee shops and his home are on a slope, making it easier for the office worker to walk downhill both to work and back home. This could be a possible explanation for why he always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and the second one in the evening.
- Option 2: This option states that the second coffee shop is too far away. However, the riddle does not mention that the second coffee shop is too far away, so this option does not seem to fit the scenario.
- Option 3: This option suggests that the first coffee shop is too far away. Since the office worker always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning, it is unlikely that it is too far away.

- Option 1: ""All the people left the restaurant in a moment."" This could be a possible answer as it explains why there are no people eating in the restaurant despite being told that all tables were booked.
- Option 2: ""The restaurant was soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment."" This option seems unlikely as it is not common for people to hide in a restaurant, especially when they have reservations.
- Option 3: ""All the people in the restaurant are in relationships."" This option does not seem to directly address the situation of all tables being booked but no one eating in the restaurant.
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option may be chosen if none of the other options seem to provide a satisfactory answer.

- Option 1: ""Tony's nephew is Jack's son."" This option does not make sense as it contradicts the information given in the riddle that Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew.
- Option 2: ""Jack is adopted."" This option could potentially explain the situation, as Jack being adopted would mean that Tony and Jack are not biological brothers, hence Tony's nephew not being Jack's nephew.
- Option 3: ""Jack and Tony share same father but not mother."" This option also could explain the situation, as it suggests that Tony and Jack are half-brothers, sharing the same father but having different mothers.
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option does not seem to be the best choice based on the analysis of the previous options.

Step 2:
Comparing Option 2 and Option 3, both could potentially explain the riddle. However, Option 3 seems to be a more straightforward and logical explanation, as it maintains the relationship of Tony and Jack as brothers while also explaining how Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. Therefore, the best option is: Option 3: ""Jack and Tony share same father but not mother."""
