- Option 1: ""The lazy farmer is his mother."" This option could be a feasible answer as it explains the unusual relationship between the hardworking farmer and the lazy farmer.
- Option 2: ""The lazy farmer is not a responsible father as he is lazy."" This option does not directly address the relationship between the two farmers.
- Option 3: ""The diligent farmer devoted himself to the farm and gradually forgot his father."" This option also does not directly address the relationship between the two farmers.

crushed them.","Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.",None of above.,2,"Step 1:
- Option 1: This option suggests that the sound of the train scared Romeo and Juliet, causing them to die. However, it doesn't explain the presence of glass shards and water on the floor.
- Option 2: This option implies that the rumble of the train caused a shelf to fall on Romeo and Juliet, leading to their death. This could explain the glass shards, but not the water on the floor.
- Option 3: This option introduces the idea that Romeo and Juliet are fish, and the train caused their tank to fall and break. This could explain both the glass shards and the water on the floor.

Considering the context provided in the riddle, the most plausible explanation seems to be Option 3: ""Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive."" This option explains the presence of glass shards and water on the floor, making it the best answer to the riddle. 

Therefore, the answer is: Option 3"
How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow,In ech leap year.,In the first year of graduation.,It happens every year.,None of above.,0,"Step 1:
- Option 1: ""In each leap year."" This option seems plausible because in a leap year, February 29th is added, which could potentially create a situation where you are one year younger than tomorrow before your birthday.
- Option 2: ""In the first year of graduation."" This option does not seem to directly relate to the riddle, as graduation does not necessarily impact your age in relation to your birthday.
- Option 3: ""It happens every year."" This option also seems plausible because every year, there is a point in time where you are one year younger than tomorrow before your birthday.

- Option 2: ""The captain."" This could also be a possible answer as the captain would likely take on the role of team captain if the assistant captain departed.
- Option 3: ""The second officer."" This does not seem like a logical answer as the second officer would not typically be next in line for the captaincy.
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This could be a possibility if there is a different hierarchy within the team.

Step 2:
Considering the context of the riddle and the options provided, the best answer would be ""Option 2: The captain."" This is because the captain is usually the leader of the team and would likely step up to the role of team captain if the assistant captain departed."

How many times can you divide 100 by 10?,Infinite time.,Once.,Two times.,None of above.,2,"Step 1:
- Option 1: ""Infinite time."" - This doesn't seem correct because there is a limit to how many times you can divide 100 by 10.
- Option 2: ""Once."" - This also doesn't seem correct because you can divide 100 by 10 more than once.
- Option 3: ""Two times."" - This seems plausible because you can divide 100 by 10 two times (100/10 = 10, 10/10 = 1).
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This could be a possibility if none of the other options are correct.

- Option 1: ""Twenty people."" This option seems too low considering there are 200 names in the list of criminals in the prisons.
- Option 2: ""Eighty people."" This option seems plausible as it is a reasonable number to find from the list of 200 names.
- Option 3: ""Two hundred people."" This option seems unlikely as it would mean all the criminals are already in the list of 200 names.
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option seems unlikely as Option 2 seems like a reasonable answer.

Step 2: Comparing the options:
Based on the riddle and the list of 200 names in the prisons, the best option seems to be Option 2: ""Eighty people."" This is because it is a reasonable number to find from the list of 200 names and fits the context of the riddle.

Who did the firemen arrest?",The two covered their face.,All of them.,The two with no masks.,None of above.,0,"Step 1:
- Option 1: ""The two covered their face."" This option seems plausible because the firemen might have arrested the two individuals who were covering their faces, assuming they were trying to hide their identity.
- Option 2: ""All of them."" This option could also be a possibility if the firemen were unsure of who was involved in the burglary and decided to arrest all four individuals.
- Option 3: ""The two with no masks."" This option does not seem likely as it contradicts the information given in the riddle, which states that two people were covering their faces.
