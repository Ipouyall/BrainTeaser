- Option 1: ""In each leap year."" This option seems plausible as in a leap year, February 29th is added, which could potentially make someone one year younger than tomorrow before their birthday.
- Option 2: ""In the first year of graduation."" This option does not seem to directly relate to the riddle, as the concept of being one year younger than tomorrow before your birthday does not specifically apply to the first year of graduation.
- Option 3: ""It happens every year."" This option also seems plausible as the riddle implies that this situation occurs annually.
- Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option may not be the best choice as Options 1 and 3 seem to have some relevance to the riddle.

Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.",It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.,None of above.,0,"Step 1:
- Option 1: It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn. This option seems plausible as the egg could roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.
- Option 2: There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole. This option is also feasible as the egg could have dropped into a hole in the roof.
- Option 3: It didn't because roosters don't lay eggs. This option is not correct as it contradicts the premise of the riddle.

The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.",He was a photograph the other people were there to honor a former player.,None of above.,2,"Step 1:
Option 1: This option doesn't seem likely as being an excellent football player doesn't necessarily mean you can avoid rain in high speed.

Who did the firemen arrest?",The two covered their face.,All of them.,The two with no masks.,None of above.,0,"Step 1:
- Option 1: ""The two covered their face."" This option seems plausible because the firemen might have arrested the two individuals who were covering their faces, assuming they were trying to hide their identity.
- Option 2: ""All of them."" This option could also be a possibility if the firemen were unsure of who was involved in the burglary and decided to arrest all four individuals.
- Option 3: ""The two with no masks."" This option does not seem likely since it was mentioned that two people were covering their faces, so the firemen would not have arrested the two without masks.
