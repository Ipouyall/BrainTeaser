Explanation: 
If 10% of the population of the city are criminals and the police have already caught 200 of them, then the total number of criminals in the city would be 200 / (10/100) = 2000. 
Since the police have already caught 200 criminals, they would need to find the remaining 2000 - 200 = 1800 criminals. 
If the police have a list of 200 names of criminals already caught, they would need to find 1800 - 200 = 1600 more criminals.

Explanation: 
Let's break down the information given in the riddle:
- The professional runner ran a total of 70 kilometers over 5 days.
- Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day.

If we work backwards from the total distance of 70 kilometers, we can calculate the distance the runner ran on each day:
Day 5: x + 8 = 70 (since each day he ran 2 kilometers more than the previous day)
x = 62 kilometers on Day 5
Day 4: x + 6 = 62
x = 56 kilometers on Day 4
Day 3: x + 4 = 56
x = 52 kilometers on Day 3
Day 2: x + 2 = 52
x = 50 kilometers on Day 2
Day 1: x = 50 - 2 = 48 kilometers on Day 1

Therefore, the runner ran 48 kilometers on the first day, which aligns with Option 2: ""Six."""
