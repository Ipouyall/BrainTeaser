"A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take ?",Three hours.,Two and a half hours.,Two hours.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Three hours.""

Explanation: If the driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for five times, it means there will be 10 stops in total (5 stops x 2 halves). Each stop takes half an hour, so 10 stops x 0.5 hours = 5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is not Option 1.

Option 2: ""Two and a half hours.""

Explanation: Following the same logic as above, with 10 stops each taking half an hour, the total time for all stops would be 5 hours. However, since the question asks how long the stops take, the answer is 5 hours divided by 2 (since each stop is half an hour) which equals 2.5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2.

Option 3: ""Two hours.""

Explanation: If the driver makes a stop every half an hour for five times, the total time for all stops would be 5 hours. However, since each stop takes half an hour, the total time for all stops is 5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is not Option 3.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""

Explanation: This option is not correct as Option 2, ""Two and a half hours,"" is the correct answer based on the explanation provided above.

Therefore, the best option is: Option 2, ""Two and a half hours."""

Option 3: ""In the period of BC.""

Explanation: This option suggests that Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year in the period of BC (Before Christ). However, this is not correct as Christmas Day is a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, and New Year's Day is based on the Gregorian calendar.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""

Explanation: The riddle states that the lion is tied to a 6m long piece of metal, but it does not mention that the other end of the metal is tied to anything.

The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.","Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.",None of above.,1,"Option 2: ""Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.""

Explanation: The key to solving this riddle is to focus on the fact that you are the one strolling into the room and lying down on the bed.
