{"question": "A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?", "option 1": "One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.", "option 2": "A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way.", "option 3": "They are all boys.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that one of the children is considered both a boy and a girl at the same time, which would make the total number of boys equal to half of the total number of kids.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1"}

It plays on the wording of the riddle to provide a logical explanation for why Tom lost the bet.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 1"}
{"question": "When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, \"No John, not the gun!\" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was.

{"question": "A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take ?", "option 1": "Three hours.", "option 2": "Two and a half hours.", "option 3": "Two hours.", "option 4": "None of above.", "gpt": "Option 1: \"Three hours.\"\n\nExplanation: If the driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for five times, it means there will be 10 stops in total (5 stops x 2 halves). Each stop takes half an hour, so 10 stops x 0.5 hours = 5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is not Option 1.\n\nOption 2: \"Two and a half hours.\"\n\nExplanation: Following the same logic as above, with 10 stops each taking half an hour, the total time for all stops would be 5 hours. However, since the question asks how long the stops take, the answer is 5 hours divided by 2 (since each stop is half an hour) which equals 2.5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2.\n\nOption 3: \"Two hours.\"\n\nExplanation: If the driver makes a stop every half an hour for five times, the total time for all stops would be 5 hours. However, since each stop takes half an hour, the total time for all stops is 5 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is not Option 3.\n\nOption 4: \"None of the above options are correct.\"\n\nExplanation: This option is not correct as Option 2, \"Two and a half hours,\" is the correct answer based on the explanation provided above.\n\nTherefore, the best option is: Option 2, \"Two and a half hours.\""}

For example, in the year 2000, both Christmas Day and New Year's Day fell in the same year.\n\nOption 2: \"It happens every year.\"\n\nExplanation: This option implies that Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. This is not accurate as Christmas Day is always on December 25th and New Year's Day is always on January 1st of the following year.\n\nOption 3: \"In the period of BC.\"\n\nExplanation: This option suggests that Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year in the period of BC (Before Christ).
