"In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?",The lazy farmer is his mother.,The lazy farmer is not a responsible father as he is lazy.,The diligent farmer devoted himself to the farm and gradually forgot his father.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The lazy farmer is his mother.""
This option seems plausible. The riddle states that the lazy farmer is not the father of the diligent farmer, but it does not rule out the possibility of the lazy farmer being his mother. This option does not involve any supernatural elements or unusual events, and it fits within the limits of realistic imagination. 

Option 2: ""The lazy farmer is not a responsible father as he is lazy.""
This option is a bit misleading. The riddle does not ask about the character or responsibility of the lazy farmer. It asks about the relationship between the two farmers. Therefore, this option does not seem to answer the riddle correctly.

Option 3: ""The diligent farmer devoted himself to the farm and gradually forgot his father.""
This option is also misleading. The riddle does not ask about the diligent farmer's devotion to his work or his memory of his father. It asks about the relationship between the two farmers. Therefore, this option does not seem to answer the riddle correctly.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is not correct because option 1 seems to answer the riddle correctly.

After considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?",They were sleeping and scared by the sound of track.,"The rumble of the train moved the shelf which 
crushed them.","Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""They were sleeping and scared by the sound of track."" This option doesn't explain the presence of glass shards and water on the floor. 

Option 2: ""The rumble of the train moved the shelf which crushed them."" This option could explain the glass shards if there was something made of glass on the shelf, but it doesn't explain the presence of water. 

Option 3: ""Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive."" This option explains all the elements of the riddle: the glass shards and water (from the broken fish tank), the rural location (trains often pass through rural areas), and the cause of death (fish cannot survive out of water). 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because Option 3 provides a logical and complete explanation for the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow,In ech leap year.,In the first year of graduation.,It happens every year.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""In each leap year."" This option doesn't seem to make sense. Leap years have an extra day in February, but this doesn't affect the age difference between today and tomorrow.

Option 2: ""In the first year of graduation."" This option also doesn't seem to make sense. Graduation is a milestone in education, not something that affects the age difference between today and tomorrow.

Option 3: ""It happens every year."" This option seems to be the most logical. The day before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be tomorrow, which is your birthday. This happens every year, regardless of leap years or graduation.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is incorrect because Option 3 is correct.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?,The first officer.,The captain.,The second officer.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The first officer."" This option might seem logical if we were talking about a ship or a plane, where the first officer is the second in command and would take over if the captain were unable to perform their duties. However, in a sporting context, the term ""first officer"" is not typically used.

Option 2: ""The captain."" This option seems the most logical. In most sporting organizations, the captain is the leader of the team. If an assistant captain departs, it would not typically affect the captain's role or position. The captain would continue to serve as the team's captain.

Option 3: ""The second officer."" Similar to the first option, this term is not typically used in a sporting context. It might be relevant in a military or naval context, but it doesn't seem to fit the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option would only be correct if none of the other options were accurate. However, as we've discussed, the captain would likely continue to serve as the team's captain if an assistant captain departed.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?",One hundred people.,Ninty-five people.,Five people.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""One hundred people."" This option suggests that all 100 people selected from the phone directory have unlisted numbers. However, this is not possible because if their numbers were unlisted, they wouldn't be in the phone directory to begin with.

Option 2: ""Ninety-five people."" This option suggests that 95% of the people selected from the phone directory have unlisted numbers. However, this is also not possible for the same reason as option 1.

Option 3: ""Five people."" This option suggests that 5% of the people selected from the phone directory have unlisted numbers. However, this is also not possible because if their numbers were unlisted, they wouldn't be in the phone directory to begin with.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option suggests that none of the previous options are correct. Given the logic explained above, this seems to be the most likely answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"Two entries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, ""Why are you smiling?"" How did he know that his companion was smiling?","Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.",One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.,The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: This option is plausible. The riddle does not specify that the guards were standing back to back. They could have been standing side by side or at an angle that allowed them to see each other's faces. This option does not involve any supernatural abilities or unusual events, and it fits within the limits of realistic imagination.

Option 2: This option suggests that one of the guards had an unusual vision that allowed him to see what happened behind him. This is not a realistic or logical solution, as it involves a supernatural ability. Therefore, this option is not likely to be the correct answer.

Option 3: This option suggests that the smiling guard's action was so big that even the guard behind him could see it. This is not a realistic or logical solution, as it is not possible for someone to see another person's facial expression if they are standing behind them and looking in the opposite direction. Therefore, this option is not likely to be the correct answer.

Option 4: This option suggests that none of the above options are correct. However, as we have already established, Option 1 is a plausible and logical solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost.
Why did he fail to win the bet?",A house can not jump.,That dog species were famous for their jumping ability.,The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""A house can not jump."" This option seems to be a play on words. It's true that a house cannot jump, so technically any jump the dog makes would be higher than the house's jump, which is non-existent. This could be the answer if the riddle is using misdirection and wordplay.

Option 2: ""That dog species were famous for their jumping ability."" This option seems unlikely. Even if a dog species is known for its jumping ability, it's highly unlikely that it could jump higher than a house. This option doesn't seem to fit with the riddle's logic.

Option 3: ""The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog."" This option seems unlikely as well. Even if the house was tiny, it would still be unusual for a dog to be able to jump higher than it. This option also doesn't seem to fit with the riddle's logic.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is only correct if none of the other options are. Given the analysis of the other options, this seems unlikely.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer seems to be Option 1: ""A house can not jump."" This answer uses wordplay and misdirection, which are common in riddles. The neighbor lost the bet because he didn't consider the literal meaning of the words."
How many times can you divide 100 by 10?,Infinite time.,Once.,Two times.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Infinite time."" This option seems to suggest that you can divide 100 by 10 an infinite number of times. However, this is not correct. After the first division, you would be left with 10, and if you divide 10 by 10, you would be left with 1. After that, you cannot divide by 10 anymore without getting into fractions or decimals. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""Once."" This option suggests that you can divide 100 by 10 only once. This is technically correct, as after the first division, you would be left with 10, and if you divide 10 by 10, you would be left with 1. However, the question does not specify that you cannot continue dividing into fractions or decimals, so this option might not be the most accurate.

Option 3: ""Two times."" This option suggests that you can divide 100 by 10 two times. This is also technically correct, as after the first division, you would be left with 10, and if you divide 10 by 10, you would be left with 1. After that, you cannot divide by 10 anymore without getting into fractions or decimals. So, this option is also correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option suggests that none of the previous options are correct. However, as we have seen, both Option 2 and Option 3 are technically correct, depending on how you interpret the question. So, this option is not correct.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle ""How many times can you divide 100 by 10?"" would be 'Option 3: ""Two times.""' This is because you can divide 100 by 10 to get 10, and then divide 10 by 10 to get 1, which is two divisions in total."
"In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals poilce starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?",Twenty people.,Eighty people.,Two hundred people.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Twenty people."" This option seems to be a random number without any clear connection to the information given in the riddle. 

Option 2: ""Eighty people."" Again, this option seems to be a random number without any clear connection to the information given in the riddle. 

Option 3: ""Two hundred people."" This option could be a possible answer as the police have a list of 200 names of criminals. However, the riddle states that the police are going out to search for the rest of the criminals, implying that they are looking for criminals not on their list. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could be a possible answer as the riddle does not provide enough information to determine a specific number of criminals the police can find. The riddle states that the number of criminals is approximately 10% of the city's population, but we do not know the total population of the city. Also, the riddle states that the police are going out to search for the rest of the criminals, but we do not know how successful they will be in their search.

Considering all the options and the information given in the riddle, the most logical answer would be 'Option 4'. The riddle does not provide enough information to determine a specific number of criminals the police can find."
When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?,In the period of BC.,It happens every year.,In the first year of each century.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""In the period of BC."" This option seems unlikely. The concept of Christmas and New Year's Day as we know them today did not exist in the BC era. 

Option 2: ""It happens every year."" This option might seem confusing at first, but if you think about it, Christmas and New Year's Day do fall in the same year every year. Christmas falls on December 25th and New Year's Day falls on January 1st, both dates are in the same year.

Option 3: ""In the first year of each century."" This option is not correct. The first year of each century would not affect when Christmas and New Year's Day fall.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is not correct because we have already established that Option 2 is a possible answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?",His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him.,Because roosters don't lay eggs.,Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""His neighbor always stolen eggs away from him."" This option could be possible if we were talking about hens, but the riddle specifically mentions roosters. Roosters do not lay eggs, so this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""Because roosters don't lay eggs."" This is a fact. Roosters are male chickens and do not have the ability to lay eggs. This option seems to be the most logical and correct answer to the riddle.

Option 3: ""Roosters will eat their own eggs once they were laid."" This option is not correct because, as mentioned before, roosters do not lay eggs.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because Option 2 is the correct answer to the riddle.

So, the best and the most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?",Since the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement,"Since Mark was a crazy fan of football, only a football player can be considered as great player in his mind.","Since Mark stood closest to the football players, he only focused on football players and didn't notice others.",None of above.,3,"Option 1: This option suggests that the playground was specifically a football playground, which would mean that other sports players wouldn't be present. However, the riddle mentions that there were players from basketball, volleyball, and even swimmers present. So, this option doesn't seem to fit the information given in the riddle.

Option 2: This option suggests that Mark is a big fan of football and therefore, he would only consider a football player as a great player. However, the riddle doesn't provide any information about Mark's preferences or interests. Therefore, this option is based on an assumption and not on the information provided in the riddle.

Option 3: This option suggests that Mark was standing closest to the football players and therefore, he only focused on them and didn't notice the others. However, the riddle doesn't provide any information about where Mark was standing or his proximity to the players. Therefore, this option is also based on an assumption and not on the information provided in the riddle.

Option 4: This option suggests that none of the above options are correct. Given that options 1, 2, and 3 are based on assumptions and not on the information provided in the riddle, this option seems to be the most logical and fitting.

Therefore, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?",The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.,"
The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.","He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.
",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed."" This option seems unlikely as it's not possible to avoid raindrops even if you're an athlete. 

Option 2: ""The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain."" This option also seems unlikely as it's not possible to avoid raindrops just by luck.

Option 3: ""He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral."" This option seems plausible. The man who stayed dry could be in a coffin because he is dead. The other men were attending his funeral. This would explain why he stayed dry while the others got wet in the rain.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because option 3 seems to be a plausible answer.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?","She was at the zoo.
",She become brave in sudden.,She tried to scare the bear.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""She was at the zoo."" This option is plausible. If the woman was at the zoo, she would not be afraid of the bear because it would be in a cage or behind a barrier. Her running towards it could be due to excitement to see the bear up close.

Option 2: ""She become brave in sudden."" This option is less likely. While it's possible for someone to suddenly become brave, it's not a common or natural reaction to seeing a bear in the wild. Most people would be afraid and try to get away from the bear.

Option 3: ""She tried to scare the bear."" This option is also unlikely. Bears are dangerous animals and trying to scare one could lead to a dangerous situation. It's not a recommended action when encountering a bear.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is always a possibility, but based on the information given in the riddle, one of the other options seems more likely.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle would be 'Option 1'. The woman was at the zoo, which is why she wasn't afraid of the bear and ran towards it excitedly."
A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?,He is a jumping athlete.,Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other,"One house is much higher than another, providing him enough time to fly in the air.",None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""He is a jumping athlete."" This option could be possible, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he could jump from one house to another. Even the best athletes can't jump such a distance without any aid. So, this option is less likely.

Option 2: ""Two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other."" This option seems more plausible. If the houses were right next to each other, the man could have easily jumped from one house to the other. This doesn't require any special abilities or unusual circumstances.

Option 3: ""One house is much higher than another, providing him enough time to fly in the air."" This option seems unlikely. Even if one house was much higher than the other, it doesn't mean that the man could fly in the air. Humans can't fly, and jumping from a higher point doesn't provide enough time to fly in the air.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is always a possibility, but based on the analysis of the other options, it seems less likely.

Based on the analysis, the most logical answer would be 'Option 2'."
"""The attorney is my brother,"" testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?",The attorney was not loved by family and hadmoved away when he was young.,"The accountant was his sister.
",The attorney is angry about his brother not being a attorney and cut ties with him.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The attorney was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young."" This option suggests a family dispute or estrangement, but it doesn't explain why the attorney would deny having a brother. Even if he moved away and was not loved by his family, he would still technically have a brother. So, this option is not the correct answer.

Option 2: ""The accountant was his sister."" This option could be the correct answer. If the accountant is the attorney's sister, then the attorney's statement that he does not have a brother is true. And the accountant's statement that the attorney is her brother is also true. This option fits the riddle perfectly without any contradictions.

Option 3: ""The attorney is angry about his brother not being an attorney and cut ties with him."" Similar to Option 1, this option suggests a family dispute. But again, even if the attorney cut ties with his brother, he would still technically have a brother. So, this option is not the correct answer.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is not the correct answer because Option 2 is a valid solution to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"""The attorney is my brother,"" the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?","The accountant was his sister.
",The attorney is angry about his brother not being a attorney and cut ties with him.,The attorney was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The accountant was his sister."" This option could be correct. The attorney could be telling the truth about not having a brother because the accountant is his sister. This would mean that the accountant is also telling the truth when she says the attorney is her brother. This option does not involve any supernatural elements or unusual events, and it does not involve any gender bias. It is a simple and logical solution to the riddle.

Option 2: ""The attorney is angry about his brother not being a attorney and cut ties with him."" This option could be incorrect. Even if the attorney is angry and has cut ties with his brother, that does not change the fact that he has a brother. Therefore, if this were the case, the attorney would be lying when he says he does not have a brother.

Option 3: ""The attorney was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young."" This option could be incorrect. Similar to Option 2, even if the attorney moved away and was not loved by his family, that does not change the fact that he has a brother. Therefore, if this were the case, the attorney would be lying when he says he does not have a brother.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could be incorrect. As we have seen, Option 1 is a logical and possible solution to the riddle. Therefore, it is not true that none of the options are correct.

Based on this analysis, the best and most logical option is 'Option 1'."
Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?,One mother give his $7 to his son.,Two daughters share the $7.,"They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""One mother give his $7 to his son."" This option is incorrect because it introduces a new character (the son) who is not mentioned in the riddle. Also, the use of ""his"" is incorrect as it should be ""her"" when referring to a mother.

Option 2: ""Two daughters share the $7."" This option is incorrect because it suggests that the two daughters are separate from the two mothers, which would mean there are four people. But the riddle states that they divide the $21 equally amongst themselves, which would not be possible if there were four people.

Option 3: ""They are one daughter, one mother and one grandmother."" This option is correct. The riddle is a play on words. The two mothers could be a woman and her mother (making them both mothers) and the two daughters could be the same woman and her daughter (making them both daughters). This would mean there are actually only three people: a grandmother, a mother (who is also a daughter), and a daughter (who is also a mother). They could each receive $7, dividing the $21 equally.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 provides a logical and correct solution to the riddle.

So, the answer is 'Option 3'."
A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?,A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way.,One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.,They are all boys.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way."" This option seems to suggest that the gender of the children is determined by how they are raised, which is not accurate. Gender is biologically determined, not influenced by upbringing. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time."" This option could be possible if one of the children is intersex or identifies as both genders. However, the riddle does not provide any information to suggest this, so it's not the most likely answer.

Option 3: ""They are all boys."" This is the correct answer. If all nine children are boys, then it is true that half of them (rounded down) are boys. This answer fits the riddle perfectly without requiring any additional assumptions or information.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because Option 3 is the correct answer.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour.
How long do the drugs keep you going?",One and a half hours.,Two hours.,An hour.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""One and a half hours."" - This would be the case if you took the first medicine, then half an hour later took the second, and then half an hour later took the third. But the riddle doesn't specify that you take the medicines one after the other. 

Option 2: ""Two hours."" - This would be the case if you took the first medicine, waited an hour, then took the second, waited another hour, and then took the third. But again, the riddle doesn't specify that you take the medicines with an hour gap.

Option 3: ""An hour."" - This would be the case if you took the first medicine, waited half an hour, and then took the second. But the riddle mentions three medicines, not two.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This could be the correct answer if none of the above options are correct. 

Considering the riddle, it says you have three medicines to take every half hour. This could mean you take the first medicine, wait half an hour, take the second medicine, wait another half an hour, and then take the third medicine. So, you would be taking medicines for an hour. 

So, the most logical answer to this riddle would be 'Option 3: ""An hour.""'"
"A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost.
Why did he lose the bet?",A house can not jump.,The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog.,That dog species were famous for their jumping ability.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""A house can not jump."" This option is playing with the wording of the riddle. It's not that the dog can jump higher than the height of the house, but rather that the dog can jump and a house can't. This is a clever twist on the wording and could be the correct answer.

Option 2: ""The height of the tiny house is lower than the dog."" This option is assuming that the house is very small, smaller than the dog. However, the riddle does not mention anything about the size of the house, so this assumption is not based on any information given in the riddle.

Option 3: ""That dog species were famous for their jumping ability."" This option is assuming that the dog is of a species that is known for its ability to jump high. However, the riddle does not mention anything about the breed of the dog, so this assumption is not based on any information given in the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is stating that none of the other options are correct. However, as we have analyzed, option 1 seems to be a plausible answer.

Based on the analysis, the best and most logical option is 'Option 1'."
"A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?",The ground is not wet.,The one is walking on his hands.,"By walking on stilts, the one elevates his feet above the wet ground.",None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The ground is not wet."" This is a plausible answer. If the ground is not wet, then the student's feet would not get wet, regardless of whether he is wearing rubber boots or not.

Option 2: ""The one is walking on his hands."" This is an unlikely answer. While it is technically possible for someone to walk on their hands, it is not a practical or common way to move around, especially for a lengthy stroll around the park.

Option 3: ""By walking on stilts, the one elevates his feet above the wet ground."" This is also an unlikely answer. While walking on stilts would keep the student's feet dry, it is not a practical or common way to move around, especially for a lengthy stroll around the park.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 1 is a plausible answer.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?",It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.,It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.," There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.",None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.""
This option is plausible, but it assumes that roosters can lay eggs, which is not true in reality. 

Option 2: ""It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.""
This option is correct because roosters, being male, do not lay eggs. This is a common knowledge fact and does not require any supernatural or unrealistic assumptions.

Option 3: "" There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.""
This option, like the first one, assumes that roosters can lay eggs, which is not true. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is incorrect because Option 2 is a correct answer.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible？","James was at the zoo.
",It is too cold outside.,James is not healthy.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""James was at the zoo."" This option is plausible. If James was at the zoo, he could be surrounded by several hungry bears, but they would not harm him because they are in their enclosures. 

Option 2: ""It is too cold outside."" This option does not provide a logical explanation for why the bears would not harm James. Bears can survive in cold weather, and their hunger would not be affected by the temperature.

Option 3: ""James is not healthy."" This option also does not provide a logical explanation. Bears would not be able to determine James's health status just by looking at him, and even if they could, it would not necessarily deter them.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is not correct because Option 1 is a plausible explanation.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?",One and a half hours.,An hour.,Two hours.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""One and a half hours."" - This might seem like the correct answer at first glance, because you're taking a pill every half hour. However, this doesn't account for the first pill you take immediately.

Option 2: ""An hour."" - This is the correct answer. You take the first pill right away, the second pill after half an hour, and the third pill after another half hour. So, in total, the pills last you an hour.

Option 3: ""Two hours."" - This would be the answer if you waited half an hour before taking the first pill, but the riddle doesn't specify that.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This is not the correct answer because option 2 is correct.

So, the answer is 'Option 2'."
how many times can you deduct 10 from 100?,Once.,Infinite time.,Twice.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Once."" This could be the answer because after you deduct 10 from 100 once, you no longer have 100. 

Option 2: ""Infinite time."" This is not possible because you cannot deduct 10 from 100 an infinite number of times. 

Option 3: ""Twice."" This is not correct because after deducting 10 twice, you would have 80 left, not 100.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This is not the answer because we have already established that option 1 could be a possible answer.

So, the answer to the riddle ""how many times can you deduct 10 from 100?"" is 'Option 1'."
"The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful ""yes"" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
","They were triplets.
",Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.,One of the gril was not loved by their family.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""They were triplets.""
This option could be a possible answer. The girls could be part of a set of triplets (or even quadruplets, quintuplets, etc.), which would mean they are not twins, but still share the same parents and were born on the same day.

Option 2: ""Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.""
This option doesn't really answer the riddle. Even if their parents raised them differently due to financial constraints, it doesn't explain how they could be born on the same day, from the same parents, and not be twins.

Option 3: ""One of the girl was not loved by their family.""
This option also doesn't answer the riddle. The girls' relationship with their family doesn't affect whether or not they are twins.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is incorrect because Option 1 is a possible answer to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?",They were sleeping and scared by the sound of track.,The rumble of the train moved the shelf which crushed them.,"Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""They were sleeping and scared by the sound of track."" This option seems unlikely. The sound of a train track wouldn't typically cause death, even if it did scare them.

Option 2: ""The rumble of the train moved the shelf which crushed them."" This option could be possible, but there's no mention of a shelf falling or any evidence of a crushing injury.

Option 3: ""Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive."" This option seems the most plausible. The riddle doesn't specify that Romeo and Juliet are humans, and the presence of water and glass could indicate a broken fish tank. The remote location and the nearby railroad track could explain why the tank fell and broke.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is always a possibility, but given the clues in the riddle, option 3 seems the most likely.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"If the vise coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?",The coach.,The captain.,The team's management,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The coach."" This seems like the most logical choice. If the vice coach is unable to attend, the coach would naturally step in and lead the team. 

Option 2: ""The captain."" While the captain does play a leadership role within the team, they are not typically responsible for coaching duties. 

Option 3: ""The team's management."" The management of a team usually handles administrative and logistical tasks, not coaching duties. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option would only be correct if none of the other options were viable, which is not the case here.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - ""No John, not the gun!"" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?",The dead man was the relative of both doctor and lawyer.,The policeman thought a doctor or a lawyer wouldn't have the name John.,The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The dead man was the relative of both doctor and lawyer."" This option doesn't provide any clear evidence that the mail man was the killer. The relationship of the dead man with the doctor and lawyer doesn't necessarily mean that the mail man is the killer. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""The policeman thought a doctor or a lawyer wouldn't have the name John."" This option is based on a stereotype and doesn't provide any concrete evidence that the mail man was the killer. The name 'John' can be used by any person regardless of their profession. So, this option is not correct.

Option 3: ""The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females."" This option seems to be the most logical one. The scream mentioned a male name 'John', so the killer must be a male. If the doctor and lawyer were females, then the mail man, being the only male, must be the killer. So, this option is correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" Since we have found a logical explanation in Option 3, this option is not correct.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
Why do old people consume more food than young people.,Older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues,Older people require increased nutrient intake to support overall health and well-being.,Because older people live longer.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues."" This option is plausible as older adults may need to consume certain foods to address health issues. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they consume more food overall.

Option 2: ""Older people require increased nutrient intake to support overall health and well-being."" This option is also plausible. As people age, their bodies may require more nutrients to maintain health. However, this doesn't necessarily mean they consume more food, as nutrient-dense food doesn't have to be large in quantity.

Option 3: ""Because older people live longer."" This option is not logical. Living longer doesn't mean consuming more food on a daily basis. It could mean consuming more food over a lifetime, but the riddle seems to be asking about daily consumption.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could be correct if none of the other options are accurate.

Considering all the options, none of them definitively answer the riddle. The riddle itself is a bit misleading as it's not necessarily true that old people consume more food than young people. Therefore, the most logical answer would be 'Option 4'."
A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?,Jack needs to to go to the hospital but no one is welling to help.,Jack is so scared of the water.,Jack is a fish in the ocean.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Jack needs to go to the hospital but no one is willing to help."" This option implies that Jack needed medical attention but didn't receive it. However, the riddle doesn't mention anything about Jack needing help or anyone refusing to help him. So, this option doesn't seem to be the correct answer.

Option 2: ""Jack is so scared of the water."" This option suggests that Jack's fear of water led to his death. However, the riddle states that Jack was swimming, which contradicts the idea that he was scared of water. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.

Option 3: ""Jack is a fish in the ocean."" This option could be the correct answer. If Jack is a fish, being knocked out of the water could indeed lead to his death, as fish need to be in water to breathe. This option fits the information given in the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option suggests that none of the previous options are the correct answer. However, as we've seen, Option 3 seems to fit the riddle's information.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?",The fat dog was the father when it is thin.,The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food.,The fat dog is the mother.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The fat dog was the father when it is thin."" This option suggests that the fat dog's physical state has changed over time, but it doesn't address the riddle's statement that the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food."" This option is making an assumption about the fat dog's behavior, but it doesn't answer the riddle's question about the relationship between the dogs. So, this option is not correct.

Option 3: ""The fat dog is the mother."" This option could be correct. The riddle states that the small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. This leaves open the possibility that the fat dog could be the thin dog's mother. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 could be a possible answer.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?",It is possible the egg would roll down the middle of the triangle-shaped top of the barn.," There is a hole in the roof. Furthermore, the egg dropped into the hole.",It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: This option is plausible if we consider the shape of the barn's roof. However, it doesn't take into account the fact that roosters don't lay eggs.

Option 2: This option introduces an unexpected element - a hole in the roof. However, it still doesn't address the fact that roosters don't lay eggs.

Option 3: This option is the most logical one. Roosters, being male, do not lay eggs. This is a common fact and doesn't require any supernatural or unusual events to be true.

Option 4: This option is a catch-all, stating that none of the other options are correct. However, as we've established, Option 3 is indeed correct.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?",The man is an excellent football player that can avoid rain in high speed.,"
The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.",He was a photograph the other people were there to honor a former player.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""The man is an excellent football player that can avoid rain in high speed."" This option seems unlikely as it's not possible for a person to avoid raindrops, no matter how fast they are. This option also leans towards a supernatural solution which we are advised to avoid.

Option 2: ""The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain."" This option also seems unlikely as it's not possible for a person to avoid raindrops just by luck, especially during a sudden shower.

Option 3: ""He was a photograph the other people were there to honor a former player."" This option is confusing and doesn't make much sense in the context of the riddle. It seems like there might be a typo or error in the phrasing.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" Given the analysis of the previous options, this seems to be the most likely answer. None of the other options provide a logical or realistic explanation for why the person didn't get wet during the sudden shower.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'. However, the riddle itself is incomplete as it doesn't provide enough information or clues to arrive at a definitive answer. A possible solution could be that the person who didn't move was already under cover or indoors."
"Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?",One mother give his $7 to his son.,Two daughters share the $7.,"They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: This option is incorrect because the riddle mentions two mothers and two daughters, not a son. 

Option 2: This option is also incorrect because it suggests that only the two daughters share the money, but the riddle states that the money is split equally between all of them.

Option 3: This option is correct. The riddle is a play on words. The two mothers are the grandmother and the mother, and the two daughters are the mother and the daughter. So, there are actually only three people involved: a grandmother (who is a mother), a mother (who is both a mother and a daughter), and a daughter. Therefore, they can split the $21 equally, each getting $7.

Option 4: This option is incorrect because Option 3 is the correct answer.

So, the answer is 'Option 3'."
"In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?",One hundred people.,Five people.,Ninty-five people.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""One hundred people."" This option is incorrect because the riddle states that only 5% of the people in the city have unlisted phone numbers. Therefore, it is not possible that all 100 people selected from the phone directory have unlisted numbers.

Option 2: ""Five people."" This option might seem correct at first glance because 5% of 100 is indeed 5. However, the riddle specifies that the names are selected from the city's phone directory. People with unlisted phone numbers are not included in the phone directory. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

Option 3: ""Ninety-five people."" This option is incorrect because it suggests that 95% of the people selected from the phone directory have unlisted numbers. This contradicts the information given in the riddle, which states that only 5% of all the people in the city have unlisted numbers.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This is the correct option. As explained above, people with unlisted phone numbers are not included in the phone directory. Therefore, if you select 100 names at random from the phone directory, none of them will have unlisted numbers.

So, the answer is 'Option 4'."
"There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?","He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.
","
The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.",The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""He was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral.""
This option seems plausible. The man who remained dry could be in a coffin, and the other men could be at his funeral. This would explain why he didn't get wet when it rained, and why he didn't drink. 

Option 2: ""The man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain.""
This option seems less likely. It's not very realistic to think that someone could avoid all the rain just by luck, especially if the other four men got wet. 

Option 3: ""The man is an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed.""
This option also seems unlikely. Even if the man is an athlete, it's not very realistic to think that he could avoid all the rain by running or moving at high speed. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is always a possibility, but it seems less likely than Option 1. 

After considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle seems to be 'Option 1'."
"Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?",Jack and Tom are the parents themselves.,Each kid's parents pooled $10 for division.,Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Jack and Tom are the parents themselves."" This option could be possible. If Jack and Tom are the parents, they could divide the $40 equally amongst themselves. However, the riddle mentions ""their parents"" which implies that Jack and Tom are not the parents.

Option 2: ""Each kid's parents pooled $10 for division."" This option seems unlikely. The riddle states that they divided the $40 equally amongst themselves. If each kid's parents pooled $10, that would only make $20, not $40.

Option 3: ""Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents."" This option seems the most logical. If Jack and Tom are brothers and they share the same parents, then there are four people in total. They could divide the $40 equally amongst themselves, each getting $10.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 seems to be the most logical answer.

So, the best and the most logical option is 'Option 3'."
Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?,Because there are less black sheep in the world than white.,Black sheep do not need food. ,"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.",None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Because there are less black sheep in the world than white."" This option could be a possible answer if we consider the riddle from a statistical perspective. If there are more white sheep than black sheep, then collectively, white sheep would consume more food. 

Option 2: ""Black sheep do not need food."" This option is not logical. All living organisms need food to survive, including black sheep. 

Option 3: ""Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature."" This option seems to be based on scientific facts about color absorption. However, it is not clear if this would significantly affect the amount of food a sheep consumes. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is a possibility if none of the other options are correct.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer seems to be 'Option 1'. This is because it is a known fact that there are more white sheep than black sheep in the world, and therefore, collectively, white sheep would consume more food."
A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?,She tried to scare the bear.,"She was at the zoo.
",She become brave in sudden.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""She tried to scare the bear."" This option seems unlikely. Generally, people don't run towards bears to scare them, as it's dangerous and could provoke the bear. 

Option 2: ""She was at the zoo."" This option seems plausible. If the woman was at a zoo, she would be separated from the bear by barriers, making it safe for her to approach without fear. 

Option 3: ""She become brave in sudden."" This option is grammatically incorrect and doesn't provide a logical explanation for why the woman wouldn't be afraid of the bear. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could be correct if none of the other options are, but in this case, Option 2 seems to be a logical answer.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?",John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future.,"John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. ""Before"" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0.",Tom gave his money to show his kindness.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future."" This option suggests a supernatural solution, which we were advised to avoid unless it's the best solution. So, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.

Option 2: ""John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. ""Before"" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0."" This option uses wordplay and misdirection, which are common in riddles. It's a clever solution that fits within the limits of realistic imagination. 

Option 3: ""Tom gave his money to show his kindness."" This option doesn't really answer the riddle. It doesn't explain how John could correctly predict the outcome of the game, which is the main point of the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is only correct if none of the other options are. Given the analysis above, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?","John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. ""Before"" any basketball game starts, the score is always 0-0.",John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future.,Tom gave his money to show his kindness.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: This option is plausible. It uses a play on words and the concept of timing to provide a solution. John could have predicted the score to be 0-0 before the game started, which is always true. This is a clever use of misdirection and dual interpretation of the phrase ""forthcoming game"".

Option 2: This option is not plausible. As per the guidelines, supernatural abilities like seeing into the future are not preferred solutions for the riddle. 

Option 3: This option is not plausible. The riddle states that Tom lost a bet, not that he gave away his money out of kindness. This option does not answer the question of how Tom lost the bet.

Option 4: This option is not plausible. As per the analysis, Option 1 provides a logical and clever solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?",The captain.,The first officer.,The second officer.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The captain."" This seems like the most logical choice. If the assistant captain resigns, the captain would still be there to lead the team. 

Option 2: ""The first officer."" This option could be possible if we consider the first officer as the next in line after the assistant captain. However, the term ""first officer"" is not commonly used in sports teams, it's more associated with naval or aviation hierarchy.

Option 3: ""The second officer."" Similar to the second option, this term is not commonly used in sports teams. It's also unclear if the second officer would be the next in line after the assistant captain.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option would only be correct if none of the other options were possible. However, the first option seems like a logical choice.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle would be 'Option 1'."
"How many times can you subtract 10 from 100? 
",Infinite time.,Twice.,Once.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Infinite time."" This option seems incorrect because if you keep subtracting 10 from 100, eventually you will reach 0 and you can't subtract 10 from 0.

Option 2: ""Twice."" This option seems logical because if you subtract 10 from 100, you get 90. Then if you subtract 10 again, you get 80. But the question doesn't specify that you have to stop subtracting when you reach a certain number, so this option might not be correct.

Option 3: ""Once."" This option seems the most logical. If you subtract 10 from 100, you get 90. But if you try to subtract 10 from 100 again, you're not really subtracting 10 from 100, you're subtracting 10 from 90. So technically, you can only subtract 10 from 100 once.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because option 3 seems to be the correct answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?,One sheep is regarded as both white and other colors same time.,A famer raises his sheep in both white way and another way.,They are all white.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""One sheep is regarded as both white and other colors same time."" This option suggests that one sheep is multicolored, which could technically make half of the sheep white. However, this is a bit of a stretch and not the most straightforward interpretation of the riddle.

Option 2: ""A famer raises his sheep in both white way and another way."" This option is unclear and doesn't directly answer the question. It seems to suggest that the farmer raises his sheep in two different ways, but it doesn't explain how half of them could be white.

Option 3: ""They are all white."" This option contradicts the riddle, which states that only half of the sheep are white.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option suggests that none of the previous options are the correct answer to the riddle.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer seems to be 'Option 1'. This is because it is the only option that could technically make half of the sheep white, even though it's not the most straightforward interpretation of the riddle."
"The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?",The officer was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young.,The officer is angry about his brother and cut ties with him.,Officer was actually his sister so the whole story makes sense,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The officer was not loved by family and had moved away when he was young."" This option doesn't explain why the officer said he doesn't have a brother anymore. It also doesn't explain why James doesn't have a brother. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""The officer is angry about his brother and cut ties with him."" This option explains why the officer said he doesn't have a brother anymore, but it doesn't explain why James doesn't have a brother. So, this option is not correct.

Option 3: ""Officer was actually his sister so the whole story makes sense."" This option explains why the officer said he doesn't have a brother anymore, because she is a sister, not a brother. It also explains why James doesn't have a brother, because the officer is his sister. So, this option is correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is not correct because option 3 is correct.

So, the best and the most logical option is 'Option 3'."
A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?,One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time.,A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way.,They are all boys.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""One child is regarded as both boy and girl same time."" This could be a possible solution if we consider the child to be intersex or gender fluid. However, the riddle does not provide any information about the gender identity of the children, so this option is based on an assumption.

Option 2: ""A man raises his children in both boy way and girl way."" This option is about the way the man raises his children, not about their gender. The riddle asks about the gender of the children, not how they are raised. So, this option is not a correct answer.

Option 3: ""They are all boys."" This option contradicts the riddle. The riddle states that males make up half of the children, so they can't all be boys.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option suggests that none of the previous options are correct. Given the analysis of the previous options, this seems to be the most likely answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with ""yes"" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?","They were triplets.
",Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.,One of the boys was not loved by their family.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""They were triplets."" This option could be a possible answer. The boys could be part of a set of triplets (or more), which would mean they aren't twins, but still share the same parents, birth date, and house.

Option 2: ""Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money."" This option doesn't answer the riddle. The boys' upbringing or financial situation doesn't change the fact that they were born on the same date to the same parents and live in the same house.

Option 3: ""One of the boys was not loved by their family."" This option also doesn't answer the riddle. The boys' family dynamics or emotional relationships don't change the fact that they were born on the same date to the same parents and live in the same house.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is incorrect because Option 1 is a possible answer to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remain dry. Why?,The ground is not wet.,"By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.",The third man is walking on his hands.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The ground is not wet."" This is a possible solution. The riddle does not specify that the field is wet, only that it is green and fuscous (dark). The men might be wearing rubber boots for other reasons, such as protection from snakes or sharp objects.

Option 2: ""By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground."" This is also a possible solution. The riddle does not specify how the third man is walking across the field. However, it seems a bit far-fetched and less likely than the first option.

Option 3: ""The third man is walking on his hands."" This is a creative solution, but it seems even more unlikely than the second option. Walking on hands across a field would be quite difficult and unusual.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is only correct if none of the other options are. Given that the first option is a plausible solution, this option is likely incorrect.

Considering all the options, the most logical and plausible solution is 'Option 1'. The riddle does not specify that the field is wet, so it is reasonable to assume that the third man's feet remain dry because the ground is not wet."

""Before"" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0.",John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future.,Tom gave his money to show his kindness.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: This option seems logical and fits within the parameters of the riddle. Before any game starts, the score is indeed 0-0. This is a clever play on words and could be the correct answer.

Option 2: This option suggests a supernatural ability, which we were advised to avoid unless it's the best solution. In this case, it's not necessary to resort to such an explanation, so this option is unlikely to be correct.

Option 3: This option doesn't really answer the riddle. It suggests a reason why Tom might willingly lose the bet, but it doesn't explain how John could predict the score. Therefore, this option is not likely to be correct.

Option 4: This option is a catch-all for any other possible answers. However, since Option 1 seems to provide a logical and clever solution to the riddle, this option is not likely to be correct.

Based on the above analysis, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, ""No John, not the gun!"" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?","The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that ""John"" was the mail man.",The policeman think a doctor or a lawyer won't have name John.,The dead man was the relative of both doctor and lawyer.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: This option assumes that the cop knew the genders of the doctor and lawyer, and that they were female. However, the riddle does not provide this information. Also, the riddle does not mention a mail man at all, so this option is not valid.

Option 2: This option assumes that a doctor or a lawyer can't have the name John. However, this is a gender bias and is not a valid assumption. The name John can be used for any profession, so this option is not valid.

Option 3: This option assumes that the dead man was a relative of both the doctor and lawyer. However, the riddle does not provide this information. Also, even if this were true, it does not explain how the cop knew who the killer was. So, this option is not valid.

Option 4: Given that none of the other options provide a valid explanation for how the cop knew who the killer was, this seems to be the most logical choice. The riddle does not provide enough information to determine how the cop knew who the killer was, so none of the above options are correct.

So, the answer is 'Option 4'."
"A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take ?",Three hours.,Two and a half hours.,Two hours.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Three hours."" This option seems to suggest that the driver stops every half an hour for an hour, which would mean the driver is stopping for a total of three hours. However, the riddle states that the driver is told to stop five times, not six. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""Two and a half hours."" This option suggests that the driver stops every half an hour for half an hour, which would mean the driver is stopping for a total of two and a half hours. However, the riddle states that the driver is told to stop five times, not five and a half. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option 3: ""Two hours."" This option suggests that the driver stops every half an hour for half an hour, which would mean the driver is stopping for a total of two hours. This would mean the driver is stopping five times, which aligns with the riddle. Therefore, this option seems to be the most logical and correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" Since we have found a logical and correct option in Option 3, this option is not correct.

Therefore, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?",Water in the tank can reflect each other in some degree.,The fish tank was like a ring.,Fish had an unusual vision so they can see what happend behind them.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Water in the tank can reflect each other in some degree."" This option is not entirely impossible, but it's not the most logical one. Reflection in water is not clear enough for the fishes to see each other every few minutes.

Option 2: ""The fish tank was like a ring."" This option seems the most logical. If the tank is circular or ring-shaped, the fishes can swim in opposite directions and still see each other every few minutes.

Option 3: ""Fish had an unusual vision so they can see what happened behind them."" This option is not very logical. While some fish species do have a wide field of vision, it's not common for them to see directly behind them.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 2 is a logical and possible solution.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?,Black sheep do not need food. ,"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature.",Because there are less black sheep in the world than white.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Black sheep do not need food."" This option is not logical because all living creatures need food to survive. So, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature."" This option seems logical as black does absorb more heat, but it doesn't necessarily mean that black sheep eat less. This option is a bit misleading and doesn't seem to be the correct answer.

Option 3: ""Because there are less black sheep in the world than white."" This option is the most logical one. The riddle is playing with words and misleading us to think about the eating habits of black and white sheep. But in reality, it's about the number of black and white sheep. If there are fewer black sheep, then collectively they would eat less than the larger number of white sheep.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 seems to be the correct answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied ""yes"" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?","They were triplets.
",One of the gril was not loved by their family.,Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""They were triplets."" This option could be a possible answer. The girls could be two of three triplets, which would explain why they look alike, have the same birthday, and are related, but are not identical twins.

Option 2: ""One of the girl was not loved by their family."" This option does not answer the riddle. The girls' familial love or lack thereof does not explain their physical similarities or shared birthday.

Option 3: ""Their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money."" This option also does not answer the riddle. The way the girls were raised does not explain their physical similarities or shared birthday.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is not correct because Option 1 does provide a plausible answer to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?,The ground is not wet.,"By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground.",The third man is walking on his hands.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The ground is not wet."" This option contradicts the riddle's description of the meadow as ""lush and muddy,"" which implies that the ground is indeed wet. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""By walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground."" This option is plausible. It provides a logical explanation for how the third man's feet could remain dry despite the wet ground and his lack of rubber boots. 

Option 3: ""The third man is walking on his hands."" This option is also plausible. If the third man is walking on his hands, his feet would not come into contact with the wet ground, keeping them dry. However, this option seems less likely than Option 2, as walking on hands across a muddy meadow would be quite difficult and unusual.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is only correct if none of the other options provide a satisfactory answer to the riddle. Given that Options 2 and 3 are both plausible, this option is not correct.

Considering all the options, the most logical and plausible answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?",The fat dog was the father when it is thin.,The fat dog is the mother.,The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The fat dog was the father when it is thin."" This option suggests that the fat dog's physical state changed over time. However, the riddle does not provide any information about the fat dog's past, so this option is not necessarily correct.

Option 2: ""The fat dog is the mother."" This option is plausible. The riddle states that the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog, but it does not rule out the possibility of the fat dog being the mother. This option fits the information given in the riddle.

Option 3: ""The fat dog is not a responsible father as he eats all the food."" This option is more of an interpretation and does not directly answer the riddle. It also introduces an element of judgement that is not present in the original riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option would only be correct if none of the other options were plausible. However, as we have seen, Option 2 is a plausible answer to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. ""Why are you smiling?"" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?",The smiling guard's action is such big that even the guard behind him can see it.,"Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other.",One of the guards had an unusual vision so he can see what happend behind him.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: This option suggests that the smiling guard's action was so big that the other guard could see it, even though they were looking in opposite directions. This seems unlikely, as the riddle does not mention any exaggerated actions or movements.

Option 2: This option suggests that the guards were facing each other, even though they were looking in opposite directions. This seems plausible, as the riddle does not specify that the guards were back to back. They could have been standing side by side, or at an angle that allowed them to see each other's faces.

Option 3: This option suggests that one of the guards had an unusual vision that allowed him to see what was happening behind him. This seems unlikely, as the riddle does not mention any supernatural abilities or unusual events.

Option 4: This option suggests that none of the above options are correct. This seems unlikely, as option 2 seems to provide a plausible explanation.

Based on the above analysis, the most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?,In the first year of each century.,It happens every year.,In the period of BC.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""In the first year of each century."" This option seems to suggest that Christmas Day and New Year's Day only fall in the same year at the start of each century. However, this is not accurate as both days occur every year.

Option 2: ""It happens every year."" This option is suggesting that Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. This is true as both days occur annually, with Christmas Day on December 25th and New Year's Day on January 1st of the following year, but still within the same 365-day period that we define as a ""year.""

Option 3: ""In the period of BC."" This option is suggesting that Christmas Day and New Year's Day only fell in the same year during the period before Christ (BC). This is not accurate as both days have continued to occur annually in the same year even after the BC period.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is suggesting that none of the other options are correct. However, as we have established, Option 2 is indeed correct.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for yelllowstone, what will happen ?",White.,Red.,Yellow.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""White."" This option seems unlikely. The riddle states that when a white shirt is put on a red and wet stone, it becomes red. So, if we follow the same logic, the shirt should change color when put on Yellowstone. 

Option 2: ""Red."" This option could be a misdirection. Just because the shirt turned red when put on a red stone, it doesn't necessarily mean it will turn red when put on Yellowstone. 

Option 3: ""Yellow."" This option seems logical at first glance. If a white shirt turns red when put on a red stone, it might turn yellow when put on Yellowstone. However, this could be a trap, as Yellowstone is not actually yellow, but a national park.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option might be the correct one. The riddle could be playing with words. Yellowstone is a national park in the U.S., not a yellow stone. Therefore, the shirt would not change color.

Considering all the options and the possible misdirection in the riddle, the best and most logical answer would be 'Option 4'."
"If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?",The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.,The other end is not tied to anything.,"The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.",None of above.,1,"Option 1: This option is incorrect because it refers to a dog and a bone, not a lion and a human. It also doesn't make sense for the lion to dig a tunnel to reach the human.

Option 2: This option could be correct. If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, the lion is not actually restrained and can move freely. This would allow it to reach the human who is 7m away.

Option 3: This option is incorrect because it refers to a horse and hay, not a lion and a human. Also, it's not mentioned in the riddle that the rope can stretch.

Option 4: This option could be correct if none of the other options are correct. However, as we have seen, Option 2 could be a valid answer.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?","Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.","Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.","Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.",None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.""
This option assumes that all animals are standing on the ground. However, the riddle states that all the animals are on the bed, not the ground. So, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.""
This option considers only the legs of the bed and your legs. It assumes that the bed and you are the only things touching the ground, which is consistent with the information given in the riddle. This seems to be a logical answer.

Option 3: ""Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.""
This option, like Option 1, assumes that all animals are standing on the ground. But the riddle states that all the animals are on the bed, not the ground. So, this option is also incorrect.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option suggests that none of the other options are correct. However, as we have seen, Option 2 seems to be a logical answer.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a cruise. How is that even doable?",The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.,"She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.",The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.""
This option seems unlikely. No matter how strong a person is, a 20-story fall would cause severe injury or death. This option does not seem to fit within the limits of realistic imagination.

Option 2: ""She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.""
This option seems more plausible. The riddle does not specify which direction the woman fell, so it is possible that she fell back into her apartment. This would explain why she was not severely injured. However, the riddle does mention a 20-story fall below her and nothing else, which might contradict this option.

Option 3: ""The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.""
This option seems unrealistic. Even the fastest humans cannot cover 100 yards in a second. This option does not seem to fit within the limits of realistic imagination.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is a possibility if none of the other options are correct. However, without knowing the correct answer, it is difficult to determine if this is the best choice.

After considering all the options, the most logical seems to be 'Option 2'. The riddle does not specify the direction of the woman's fall, and this option provides a plausible explanation for her lack of severe injury. Therefore, the answer is 'Option 2'."
Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?,A superstar.,A barber.,A woman.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""A superstar."" - This option might seem plausible as superstars often have to change their looks for different roles or appearances. However, even if a superstar shaves three times a day, they wouldn't be able to maintain a beard. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""A barber."" - This option seems more logical. A barber can shave other people's beards three times a day (or even more) and still maintain their own beard. The riddle does not specify that the person has to shave their own beard. This is a good example of a riddle using misdirection.

Option 3: ""A woman."" - This option is not correct because generally, women do not have beards to maintain.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option is not correct because we have already found a logical answer in Option 2.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?,You need to drop the egg gently.,"
You need to drop the egg hard.","No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack
",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""You need to drop the egg gently."" This seems like a logical answer, but even if you drop an egg gently, it can still crack on a concrete floor.

Option 2: ""You need to drop the egg hard."" This option is clearly incorrect. Dropping an egg hard onto a concrete floor will definitely crack it.

Option 3: ""No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack."" This option is a clever play on words. The riddle asks how to drop an egg onto a concrete floor without cracking it. It doesn't specify what shouldn't be cracked - the egg or the floor. This option assumes the riddle is asking about the floor, not the egg.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is incorrect because Option 3 is a valid answer.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: ""There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily."" Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?",Because it was daytime.,The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book.,"The man is blind and is reading braille.
",None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Because it was daytime."" This option could be a possible answer. The riddle does not specify the time of day, only that the house had no lights on. It's possible that the man was reading in natural daylight.

Option 2: ""The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book."" This option is not very clear and doesn't seem to provide a logical answer to the riddle. It suggests that the man is pretending to read the book, but the riddle states that he is reading happily, which implies he is actually reading.

Option 3: ""The man is blind and is reading braille."" This is also a possible answer. The riddle does not specify the type of book the man is reading. It's possible that he is reading a book in braille, which does not require light.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option suggests that none of the previous options provide the correct answer to the riddle. However, as we have seen, both Option 1 and Option 3 could potentially provide a logical solution to the riddle.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle would be 'Option 1' or 'Option 3'. However, since we have to choose only one, 'Option 1' seems to be the most straightforward and logical answer, as it does not require any additional assumptions (like the man being blind). Therefore, the answer is 'Option 1'."
"You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?",The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island.,"It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.","The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them. ",None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island."" This option seems unlikely as it suggests that the tractor parts were somehow dropped or fell onto the island. However, the riddle states that the tractor was not transported to the island by air, which would rule out this possibility.

Option 2: ""It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen."" This option seems plausible. The riddle does not rule out the possibility of the lake freezing over, and it would be possible to drive a tractor over a frozen lake. This would not involve building the tractor on the island or transporting it by boat or air.

Option 3: ""The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them."" This option seems unlikely. The riddle states that the tractor was not built on the island, which would rule out the possibility of the tractor parts being assembled there.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option would only be correct if none of the other options were possible. However, as we have seen, Option 2 is a plausible solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?","The history teacher, as he may have a good friend from France.","English teacher, as she have experiences in using translator.","The math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The history teacher, as he may have a good friend from France."" This option is not logical because even if the history teacher has a friend from France, it doesn't mean he can understand French. Also, the riddle states that none of Sally's teachers spoke French.

Option 2: ""English teacher, as she have experiences in using translator."" This option is also not logical because the riddle does not mention anything about the teachers using a translator. Also, using a translator would mean that the teacher understands French, which contradicts the information given in the riddle.

Option 3: ""The math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English."" This option seems logical because math is a universal language. Even if Sally wrote her answers in French, the numbers and mathematical symbols would still be the same. Therefore, the math teacher would be able to understand her work.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 is a logical answer.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer is 'Option 3'."
"On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?",His horse was called Sunday.,The man was too exhausted that he forgot his way home.,Next week is a national holiday.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""His horse was called Sunday."" This option could be possible. The riddle might be using misdirection and double meanings, leading us to think about days of the week when it could be referring to the name of the man's horse.

Option 2: ""The man was too exhausted that he forgot his way home."" This option doesn't seem to answer the riddle. The riddle doesn't mention anything about the man being lost or forgetting his way home.

Option 3: ""Next week is a national holiday."" This option also doesn't seem to answer the riddle. The riddle doesn't mention anything about a holiday.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option could be possible if none of the other options are correct. However, option 1 seems to be a plausible answer to the riddle.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle seems to be 'Option 1'."
How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?,"No problem, because sturdy bricks are very hard to crack",You need to throw the glass ball hard.,You need to throw the glass ball gently.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: This option is not correct because the riddle is about preventing the glass ball from shattering, not the brick wall.

Option 2: This option is also not correct. Throwing the glass ball hard would likely cause it to shatter upon impact with the brick wall.

Option 3: This option seems to be the most logical. Throwing the glass ball gently would reduce the force of impact, thus reducing the likelihood of the glass ball shattering.

Option 4: This option is not correct because Option 3 seems to be a valid solution.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?","Lisa is Emily's daughter.
",Emily is adopted.,Emily and William share same father but not mother.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Lisa is Emily's daughter."" This option makes sense. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, she would not be Emily's niece. She would still be William's niece if William is Emily's brother. This option fits the information given in the riddle.

Option 2: ""Emily is adopted."" This option doesn't necessarily solve the riddle. Even if Emily is adopted, Lisa could still be her niece if Emily's adopted brother is Lisa's father. 

Option 3: ""Emily and William share same father but not mother."" This option doesn't solve the riddle either. Even if Emily and William are half-siblings, Lisa could still be Emily's niece if William is her father.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is incorrect because Option 1 is a valid solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 1'."
"In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?",The one with with jewelry.,The one with important papers.,The one filled with money.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""The one with jewelry."" This could be a possible answer as jewels are valuable. However, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the most important room to save from the fire.

Option 2: ""The one with important papers."" This could also be a possible answer as crucial documents could be irreplaceable. But again, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the most important room to save from the fire.

Option 3: ""The one filled with money."" This could be a possible answer as money is valuable. However, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the most important room to save from the fire.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This could be the answer if the cops didn't prioritize any of the rooms over the others. 

Considering the riddle, it doesn't specify that the cops knew what was in each room. Also, it's not the job of the cops to put out fires, it's the job of firefighters. Therefore, the answer is 'Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""'"
"Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?","The history teacher, as he may have a good friend from France.","English teacher, as she have experiences in using translator.","The math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The history teacher, as he may have a good friend from France."" This option is not very logical because it is based on an assumption that the history teacher has a friend from France. Even if he does, it doesn't necessarily mean he can understand French. 

Option 2: ""English teacher, as she have experiences in using translator."" This option is also not very logical because it is based on an assumption that the English teacher has experience using a translator. Even if she does, it doesn't necessarily mean she can understand French. 

Option 3: ""The math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English."" This option is the most logical because math is a universal language. Regardless of the language the exam was written in, the math teacher would be able to understand the numbers and equations.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 is a logical answer.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer is 'Option 3'."
"A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?",He get medical attention.,"He jumped off the ground floor, not from the top of the building.",The building is not so tall for the man.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""He get medical attention."" This option implies that the man was hurt but received medical attention. However, the riddle states that the man didn't get hurt at all, so this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""He jumped off the ground floor, not from the top of the building."" This option could be possible. If the man jumped off the ground floor, he wouldn't get hurt. The riddle doesn't specify from which floor the man jumped, so this could be a misdirection.

Option 3: ""The building is not so tall for the man."" This option is vague and doesn't make much sense. Regardless of the man's height, jumping off a 50-story building would likely result in injury.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is only correct if none of the other options are correct. However, Option 2 seems to be a plausible answer.

Considering all the options, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."

How is this possible?",The ladder is not so tall for the boys.,He get medical attention.,He was only on the first step.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The ladder is not so tall for the boys."" This option doesn't make much sense. Regardless of the boy's height, a 100 foot ladder is still tall and falling from it would likely result in injury.

Option 2: ""He get medical attention."" This option implies that the boy was hurt, which contradicts the information given in the riddle that the boy did not get hurt.

Option 3: ""He was only on the first step."" This option is plausible. If the boy was only on the first step of the ladder when he fell, he would not have fallen far and therefore would not have been hurt.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 is a plausible answer.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?",The tide makes the boats to float again and the issues get resolved at that time.,People in village use the boat to store water because water is rare.,People in village use the boat to store fruits because it is cheap.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: This option is plausible. Coastal areas often experience tides, which are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun, and the rotation of the Earth. When the tide comes in, the water level rises and the boats can float. When the tide goes out, the water level falls and the boats are grounded. This is a common occurrence in many coastal villages around the world.

Option 2: This option seems less likely. While it's possible that people in the village could use boats to store water, the riddle doesn't provide any information to suggest that water is scarce in the area. Moreover, storing water in a boat isn't a very practical solution, as boats are designed to keep water out, not in.

Option 3: This option also seems unlikely. While it's possible that people in the village could use boats to store fruits, the riddle doesn't provide any information to suggest that this is the case. Moreover, storing fruits in a boat isn't a very practical solution, as boats are not designed for this purpose.

Option 4: This option suggests that none of the above options are correct. However, as we've discussed, Option 1 is a plausible solution to the riddle.

Based on the above analysis, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?",A business man.,A publisher.,A writer.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""A business man."" - A businessman may be involved in the book industry, but the riddle specifically mentions ""authoring"" books, which is not typically a role a businessman plays. So, this option is unlikely.

Option 2: ""A publisher."" - A publisher is involved in the production and dissemination of literature or information, but they do not typically write the content. They may be responsible for countless books without having written a single word themselves. This option seems to fit the riddle well.

Option 3: ""A writer."" - This option contradicts the riddle. A writer would have written words in the books they've authored. So, this option is not correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option would only be correct if none of the other options fit the riddle. However, as we've seen, Option 2 seems to fit the riddle well.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: ""There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?",The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book.,"The man is blind and is reading braille.
",Because it was daytime.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The man is smart that she pretended to reading the book."" This option doesn't make much sense and doesn't provide a logical explanation for how the man could read in the dark. 

Option 2: ""The man is blind and is reading braille."" This is a plausible explanation. A blind man could read braille in the dark, as braille is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired.

Option 3: ""Because it was daytime."" This option contradicts the riddle, which clearly states that the man was sitting in the house at night. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could only be correct if none of the other options provided a logical explanation, which is not the case here.

Based on the analysis, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?",The station wasn't fixed in the marina,The dolphins untied the knots.,"The waves were powerful, which pushed the boat and the marina together.",None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The station wasn't fixed in the marina"" - This option could be plausible. If the station wasn't fixed, it could have moved due to the water's movement, causing the boat to drift away. 

Option 2: ""The dolphins untied the knots."" - This option seems unlikely. While dolphins are intelligent creatures, it's not common for them to untie knots. This option seems to lean towards the supernatural or unusual events, which we are advised to avoid.

Option 3: ""The waves were powerful, which pushed the boat and the marina together."" - This option seems contradictory. If the waves were powerful enough to push the boat and the marina together, it would mean the boat would still be near the marina, not in the middle of the ocean.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option is a possibility if none of the other options are plausible.

Considering all the options, 'Option 1' seems to be the most logical and plausible answer to the riddle."
How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?,You need to drop the egg gently.,"No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack
","
You need to drop the egg hard.",None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""You need to drop the egg gently."" This option suggests that the egg won't break if it's dropped gently. However, the riddle asks about throwing the egg against a hard wall, not dropping it. So, this option doesn't answer the riddle correctly.

Option 2: ""No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack."" This option seems to misinterpret the riddle. The riddle is about the egg not breaking, not the concrete wall. So, this option doesn't answer the riddle correctly.

Option 3: ""You need to drop the egg hard."" Similar to option 1, this option suggests that the egg won't break if it's dropped hard. However, the riddle asks about throwing the egg against a hard wall, not dropping it. So, this option doesn't answer the riddle correctly.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" Given that none of the previous options correctly answer the riddle, this option seems to be the most logical choice.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?",All the people on the boat jump into the sea in a moment.,The boat is soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.,"All the people on the boat are in relationships.
",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""All the people on the boat jump into the sea in a moment."" This option seems unlikely as it would be unusual for all people on a boat to jump into the sea at the same time. 

Option 2: ""The boat is so big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment."" This option also seems unlikely as it would be difficult for all people to hide themselves at the same time, especially on a boat where there are limited places to hide.

Option 3: ""All the people on the boat are in relationships."" This option might seem confusing at first, but it's actually a play on words. The riddle says ""you don't see a single person on the boat"", which could mean you don't see any people who are single (not in a relationship). So, this option could be a possible answer.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is always a possibility, but in this case, Option 3 seems to be a clever and logical answer to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical option to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?",Green.,White.,Red.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Green."" This option doesn't seem to make sense. There's no mention of green in the context of the shirt or the Red Sea in the riddle.

Option 2: ""White."" The shirt was originally white, but the riddle asks what happens when it's thrown into the Red Sea. It's unlikely that the shirt would remain white after being thrown into the sea.

Option 3: ""Red."" This might seem like the obvious answer, given that the sea is called the ""Red Sea."" However, the Red Sea isn't actually red. Its name doesn't reflect its color. So, it's unlikely that the shirt would turn red.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" Given the analysis of the previous options, this seems like the most logical answer. The shirt wouldn't turn green or red, and it's unlikely to stay white after being thrown into the sea. 

So, the answer is 'Option 4'."
An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?,"The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home.",The second coffee shop is too far away.,The first coffee shop is too far away.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home."" This option seems plausible. If his home is at the top of a slope, he could walk downhill to the first coffee shop in the morning, continue downhill to work, then walk uphill to the second coffee shop in the evening and continue uphill to his home. This would make his daily commute easier.

Option 2: ""The second coffee shop is too far away."" This option doesn't make sense because the riddle states that the office worker always visits the second coffee shop in the evening on his way back home. Therefore, the distance to the second coffee shop is not a problem for him.

Option 3: ""The first coffee shop is too far away."" This option also doesn't make sense because the riddle states that the office worker always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning. Therefore, the distance to the first coffee shop is not a problem for him.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because Option 1 seems to be a plausible answer to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?",All the people left the restaurant in a moment.,The resturant was soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.,All the people in the restaurant are in relationships.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""All the people left the restaurant in a moment."" This option seems unlikely. It's not realistic for all the people to leave the restaurant at the exact same moment, especially without you noticing.

Option 2: ""The restaurant was so big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment."" This option also seems unlikely. It's not realistic for all the people to hide in a restaurant, especially in a moment's notice.

Option 3: ""All the people in the restaurant are in relationships."" This option doesn't seem to have any relevance to the riddle. The relationship status of the people in the restaurant wouldn't affect whether or not the tables are booked.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" Given that the first three options don't seem to provide a logical answer to the riddle, this option seems the most likely.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?",He get medical attention.,He was only on the first step.,The ladder is not so tall for the boys.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""He got medical attention."" This option implies that the young man was injured but was treated immediately. However, the riddle states that he was unharmed, so this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""He was only on the first step."" This option suggests that the young man fell from a very low height, which would not cause harm. This is a plausible answer as it fits the information given in the riddle.

Option 3: ""The ladder is not so tall for the boys."" This option is vague and does not provide a clear explanation as to why the young man was unharmed. It seems to be irrelevant to the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is only correct if none of the other options provide a satisfactory answer to the riddle. However, Option 2 seems to be a plausible answer.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non.
What is the fifth child name?",Nelson.,Nick.,Mary.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Nelson."" - This option seems to follow the pattern of the names starting with 'N'. However, the riddle clearly states that Mary's father has five children, and Mary is one of them. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""Nick."" - Similar to the first option, this name also starts with 'N'. But again, the riddle clearly mentions Mary as one of the children. So, this option is also not correct.

Option 3: ""Mary."" - This option seems to be the most logical. The riddle states that Mary's father has five children and then lists four names, including Mary's. So, it's reasonable to assume that Mary is the fifth child. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option would only be correct if none of the other options were. But as we've established, Mary is the fifth child, making option 3 correct.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?,The one with with jewelry.,The one with important papers.,The one filled with money.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""The one with jewelry."" This could be a possible answer as jewelry can be very valuable. However, the riddle does not specify that the police prioritize the most valuable room.

Option 2: ""The one with important papers."" This could also be a possible answer as important papers could be irreplaceable. However, again, the riddle does not specify that the police prioritize the room with irreplaceable items.

Option 3: ""The one filled with money."" This could be a possible answer as money is valuable. However, the riddle does not specify that the police prioritize the room with the most monetary value.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This could be the correct answer as the riddle does not specify which room the police would prioritize. In reality, the police would not be the ones to put out the fire, that would be the job of the fire department.

Considering all the options and the riddle, the most logical answer would be 'Option 4' as it is the fire department's job to put out fires, not the police's."
"In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner seven 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?",Five.,Six.,Seven.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Five."" - If the runner ran 5 kilometers on the first day and added 2 kilometers each day, he would run 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 kilometers over the five days. This totals to 45 kilometers, which is not the total distance mentioned in the riddle.

Option 2: ""Six."" - If the runner ran 6 kilometers on the first day and added 2 kilometers each day, he would run 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 kilometers over the five days. This totals to 50 kilometers, which is not the total distance mentioned in the riddle.

Option 3: ""Seven."" - If the runner ran 7 kilometers on the first day and added 2 kilometers each day, he would run 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 kilometers over the five days. This totals to 55 kilometers, which is not the total distance mentioned in the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - Since none of the first three options resulted in the total distance of 70 kilometers, this option seems to be the most logical choice.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
"You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?",The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island.,"The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them. ","It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The pieces of the tractor will fall within hail to the island."" This option seems unlikely as it suggests that the tractor parts fell from the sky, which is not a realistic scenario.

Option 2: ""The pieces of tractor is floating over the lake, you collect them and combine them."" This option also seems unlikely as it suggests that the tractor parts were floating on the lake, which is not a realistic scenario.

Option 3: ""It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen."" This option seems the most plausible. It is possible that the tractor was driven over the lake when it was frozen in winter.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 is a plausible solution.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?",Two.,One.,Three.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Two."" - If the fisherman caught two fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 = 40. This is more than the total number of fish caught, so this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""One."" - If the fisherman caught one fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 = 35. This is more than the total number of fish caught, so this option is incorrect.

Option 3: ""Three."" - If the fisherman caught three fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45. This is more than the total number of fish caught, so this option is incorrect.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - Since none of the first three options resulted in the correct total number of fish caught, this option must be the correct one.

So, the answer is 'Option 4'."
"Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?",Tony's nephew is Jack's son.,Jack is adopted.,Jack and Tony share same father but not mother.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Tony's nephew is Jack's son."" This option is possible. If Tony's nephew is Jack's son, then technically, Jack's son is not Jack's nephew. This option fits the riddle's conditions.

Option 2: ""Jack is adopted."" This option doesn't necessarily solve the riddle. Even if Jack is adopted, Tony's nephew could still be Jack's nephew if they share at least one parent.

Option 3: ""Jack and Tony share same father but not mother."" This option doesn't solve the riddle either. Even if Jack and Tony share the same father but not the same mother, Tony's nephew could still be Jack's nephew.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because Option 1 is a possible solution to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 1'."
There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?,Ten.,One.,Nine.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Ten."" This option suggests that even after shooting one bird, all ten birds remain on the fence. This is not logical as one bird has been shot and presumably would not remain on the fence.

Option 2: ""One."" This option suggests that after shooting one bird, only one bird remains on the fence. This is not logical as it does not account for the other eight birds that were not shot.

Option 3: ""Nine."" This option suggests that after shooting one bird, nine birds remain on the fence. This is logical if we assume that the other birds do not react to the shooting and continue to sit on the fence.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option suggests that none of the previous options are correct. This could be logical if we consider that the sound of the gunshot would likely scare the other birds away, leaving no birds on the fence.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer would be 'Option 4'. The sound of the gunshot would likely scare all the birds away, leaving no birds on the fence."
A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?,He works there in the restaurant.,He is a superstar.,He always finish the dish without any waste.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""He works there in the restaurant."" This is a plausible answer. If the man works at the restaurant, it's possible that he gets his meals for free as a part of his employment benefits. 

Option 2: ""He is a superstar."" While it's possible that a superstar might not have to pay for meals due to their fame, it's not a guarantee. This option is less likely than the first one.

Option 3: ""He always finish the dish without any waste."" Finishing a dish without any waste typically doesn't exempt someone from having to pay for their meal. This option is not likely.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is only correct if none of the other options are. Given that Option 1 is a plausible answer, this option is not likely.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?,Some daughters get married and have their own family.,Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.,Each daughter shares the same brother.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Some daughters get married and have their own family."" This option doesn't solve the riddle because even if the daughters get married and have their own family, they are still Mrs. Jones's daughters and the number of her children doesn't change.

Option 2: ""Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away."" This option also doesn't solve the riddle because even if some brothers moved away, they are still Mrs. Jones's children and the number of her children doesn't change.

Option 3: ""Each daughter shares the same brother."" This option solves the riddle. If each of Mrs. Jones's daughters has one brother, and Mrs. Jones only has five children, then it means that each daughter shares the same brother. So, Mrs. Jones has four daughters and one son.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 is the correct answer.

So, the best and the most logical option is 'Option 3'."
You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?,Ten.,Five.,One.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Ten."" This could be a possible answer if we consider that each person has a head and if the organization's heads are also physical heads. But this seems unlikely as the riddle does not specify that the organization's heads are physical heads.

Option 2: ""Five."" This could be the answer if we consider that each person in the room has a head. But the riddle specifies that there are five organization's heads, not five people. So, this option is also unlikely.

Option 3: ""One."" This could be the answer if we consider that the organization has one head, and the five people in the room are part of that head. But the riddle specifies that there are five organization's heads, not one. So, this option is also unlikely.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This could be the answer if none of the above options are correct. But we need to consider the riddle carefully. The riddle says, ""You enter a room with five of the organization' heads."" This implies that you are also in the room. So, there are six heads in total: your head and the five organization's heads.

So, the correct answer is 'Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct.""' because there are six heads in the room, not ten, five, or one."
"A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?",Next week is a national holiday.,His horse was called Sunday.,The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Next week is a national holiday."" This option doesn't explain how the man could leave and return on the same day of the week. The national holiday next week is irrelevant to the riddle. 

Option 2: ""His horse was called Sunday."" This option could explain the riddle. If the man's horse was named Sunday, then he could have left town on Sunday (the horse), spent the night in a motel, and then rode back the next day on Sunday (the horse). This would mean he left and returned on ""Sunday"" as the riddle states.

Option 3: ""The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly."" This option doesn't explain how the man could leave and return on the same day of the week. The cost of the hotel room is irrelevant to the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option is incorrect because Option 2 provides a plausible explanation for the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?,The first train station is too far away.,The second train station is too far away.,"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""The first train station is too far away."" This option contradicts the riddle, which states that the first station is one mile away from his home. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""The second train station is too far away."" This option also contradicts the riddle, which states that the second station is two miles away in the opposite direction. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

Option 3: ""The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter."" This option seems plausible. The riddle mentions that the student leans forward while riding his scooter, which could suggest that he is going downhill. This would also explain why he boards at the first stop in the morning (downhill from his home) and exits at the second stop in the afternoon (also downhill from his home). Therefore, this option is likely correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" Since we have a plausible answer in Option 3, this option is incorrect.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?,Each player shares the same coach.,Some players are backups and not allowed to play.,Some coach get a raise.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""Each player shares the same coach."" This option seems plausible. If each player has one coach, but there are only six participants in total, it could mean that there is one coach for all five players.

Option 2: ""Some players are backups and not allowed to play."" This option doesn't really answer the question. Even if some players are backups, the riddle states that each player has a coach, so this would still mean more than six participants.

Option 3: ""Some coach get a raise."" This option is irrelevant to the riddle. Whether a coach gets a raise or not doesn't affect the number of participants in the team.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This option could be correct if none of the other options are, but in this case, Option 1 seems to provide a logical answer to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 1'."
"Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?",Emily is adopted.,Emily and William share same father but not mother.,Lisa is Emily's daughter.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Emily is adopted."" - This option doesn't solve the riddle because even if Emily is adopted, she would still be considered William's sister and therefore Lisa would be her niece as well.

Option 2: ""Emily and William share same father but not mother."" - This option also doesn't solve the riddle because even if Emily and William have different mothers, Lisa would still be Emily's niece if she is William's niece.

Option 3: ""Lisa is Emily's daughter."" - This option could solve the riddle. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, she would be William's niece but not Emily's niece. Emily would be Lisa's mother, not her aunt.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option is not correct because option 3 provides a logical solution to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."

Why?,The first train station is too far away.,"The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter.",The second train station is too far away.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The first train station is too far away."" This option contradicts the riddle, which states that the first station is one mile away from his home. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter."" This option seems plausible. The student leans forward while riding his scooter, which is a common practice when going downhill. Also, the riddle doesn't specify the geographical layout of the area, so it's possible that his home and the stations are on a hill.

Option 3: ""The second train station is too far away."" This option also contradicts the riddle, which states that the second station is two miles away from his home. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 2 seems to be a plausible answer.

Therefore, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"there was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?",The two covered their face.,All of them.,The two with no masks.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""The two covered their face."" This could be a logical choice as people covering their faces might be trying to hide their identity, which is common in criminal activities. However, they could also be covering their faces due to smoke or dust.

Option 2: ""All of them."" This seems unlikely. Firemen are not typically responsible for making arrests, and there is no clear evidence that all four people are involved in the burglary.

Option 3: ""The two with no masks."" This seems less likely than option 1. There is no clear reason why the two without masks would be more suspicious than the two with masks.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This could be the correct answer if none of the other options are correct.

Considering all the options, the most logical answer would be 'Option 4'. Firemen are not law enforcement officers and do not have the authority to arrest anyone. Their primary role is to put out fires and rescue people. The responsibility of making arrests lies with the police."
"If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?",The other end is not tied to anything.,"The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away.",The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope.,None of above.,0,"Option 1: ""The other end is not tied to anything."" This option is plausible. If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, the dog can freely move to the bone that is 7m away. 

Option 2: ""The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay seven meters away."" This option is incorrect. Firstly, the riddle is about a dog, not a horse. Secondly, it is not mentioned anywhere in the riddle that the rope can stretch.

Option 3: ""The dog dug a 1m tunnel underground to reach the bone that was 7m away while still tied to the 6m long rope."" This option is not very plausible. It is not mentioned in the riddle that the dog can dig or that the ground is suitable for digging. 

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 1 is a plausible solution.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 1'."
"Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?",Because it was daytime.,Jessica is smart that she pretended to reading the book.,Jessica is blind and she can braille.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Because it was daytime."" This option doesn't make sense because the riddle clearly states that Jessica reads at night, in complete darkness.

Option 2: ""Jessica is smart that she pretended to reading the book."" This option is also not logical because the riddle doesn't suggest that Jessica is pretending to read. It says she reads in complete darkness.

Option 3: ""Jessica is blind and she can braille."" This option seems the most logical. If Jessica is blind, she would be able to read in complete darkness using braille. This would also explain why her parents reward her hard work with cake.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is not correct because option 3 is a logical and plausible answer to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?,Next week is a national holiday.,The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly.,His horse was called Sunday.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Next week is a national holiday."" This option doesn't provide a logical explanation for the man's ability to ride out and back into town on Sunday. The national holiday next week has no relevance to the riddle.

Option 2: ""The hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly."" This option also doesn't explain how the man could ride out and back into town on the same day, Sunday. The cost of the hotel room doesn't affect the days of the week.

Option 3: ""His horse was called Sunday."" This option provides a logical explanation for the riddle. The man rode out of town on his horse named Sunday, stayed a night at a hotel, and rode back into town on his horse, Sunday. The riddle is playing with the double meaning of ""Sunday"" as both a day of the week and a possible name.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 provides a logical and clever solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?",Amy is so well exercised that she can reach to the base in a second to catch the pet.,The pet is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.,"The pet dog fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. ",None of above.,2,"Option 1: This option suggests that Amy has superhuman abilities to reach the base of a 17-story building in a second. This is not a realistic or logical solution, so we can rule out this option.

Option 2: No matter how strong a pet dog is, it's unlikely to survive a fall from the 17th floor without any harm. This option is also not logical or realistic, so we can rule out this option as well.

Option 3: This option suggests that the pet dog fell back into the apartment, not over the edge of the balcony. This is a logical and realistic solution. The riddle does not specify the direction in which the dog fell, so it's possible that the dog fell back into the apartment.

Option 4: This option suggests that none of the above options are correct. But since Option 3 is a possible solution, we can rule out this option.

So, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You fire one. How many are there left?,Nine.,Ten.,One.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Nine."" This would be the answer if we were to take the riddle literally, assuming that firing one bird would remove it from the fence, leaving nine. However, riddles often require us to think beyond the literal interpretation.

Option 2: ""Ten."" This option suggests that firing one bird does not affect the number of birds on the fence. This could be the answer if we interpret ""fire"" in a different way, such as firing a gun, which would not necessarily hit a bird. However, it's more likely that the loud noise would scare all the birds away.

Option 3: ""One."" This option could be correct if we interpret ""fire one"" to mean that one bird is scared away, leaving one bird behind. However, this interpretation seems less likely than the others.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option suggests that none of the previous options are correct. Given the nature of riddles, this could be the answer if none of the other options fit the riddle's intended solution.

Considering all the options and the nature of riddles, the most logical answer would be 'Option 2: ""Ten.""' This is because the riddle does not specify that the bird was hit or removed from the fence, and firing a gun would likely scare all the birds away, leaving none on the fence."
"He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?",A laywer.,A preacher.,A teacher.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""A lawyer."" - Lawyers don't typically marry people, they handle legal matters. So, this option is not correct.

Option 2: ""A preacher."" - Preachers often perform marriage ceremonies, marrying many women to their partners, but they themselves are not necessarily married. This option seems to fit the riddle.

Option 3: ""A teacher."" - Teachers educate students, they don't marry people. So, this option is not correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - Since we have found a suitable answer in Option 2, this option is not correct.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names.
What is the name of the fifth child?",Nelson.,Nick.,Mary.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Nelson."" - This could be a possible answer if we were to follow the pattern of names starting with 'N'. However, the riddle already states that Mary's father is the father of five children, and Mary is one of them. So, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""Nick."" - Similar to Option 1, this name also starts with 'N'. But again, Mary is already mentioned in the riddle as one of the children. So, this option is also incorrect.

Option 3: ""Mary."" - This seems to be the most logical answer. The riddle states that Mary's father has five children and then lists four names, none of which are Mary. It's a bit of misdirection, as the answer is given in the question itself. So, this option is correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option is incorrect because Option 3 is the correct answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?",Mark.,Ana,Michael.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Mark."" - There is no mention or hint about a student named Mark in the riddle. So, this option is not likely to be correct.

Option 2: ""Ana"" - The riddle states ""Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun."" It could be interpreted that Ana is also a student at the school, making her the fourth student. This seems to be a plausible answer.

Option 3: ""Michael."" - Similar to Option 1, there is no mention or hint about a student named Michael in the riddle. So, this option is not likely to be correct.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option would only be correct if none of the other options were correct. However, Option 2 seems to be a plausible answer.

Based on the analysis, the best and most logical answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a cruise. How is that possible?,The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.,"She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.",The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""The woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling.""
This option is not logical. No matter how strong a person is, a 20-story fall would cause serious injury or death. This option is not realistic and does not fit the riddle's solution.

Option 2: ""She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside.""
This option is plausible. The riddle does not specify the direction in which the woman fell. It is possible that she fell back into her apartment, which would explain why she was not seriously hurt. This option fits the riddle's solution.

Option 3: ""The fireman is so well exercised that he reaches the woman 100 yards away in a second.""
This option is not logical. Even the fastest humans cannot cover 100 yards in a second. This option is not realistic and does not fit the riddle's solution.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is not correct because Option 2 is a plausible solution to the riddle.

Therefore, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?,A woman.,A barber.,A superstar.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""A woman."" - This option seems unlikely. While women can shave, they typically do not grow beards. This option also seems to contradict point 10 about avoiding gender bias.

Option 2: ""A barber."" - This option seems plausible. A barber can shave other people's beards three times a day (or more) and still grow their own beard. This answer fits within the limits of realistic imagination and everyday logic.

Option 3: ""A superstar."" - This option seems unlikely. While a superstar could theoretically shave three times a day, it doesn't explain how they could still grow a beard. This option doesn't seem to fit the riddle as well as the others.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option is always a possibility, but in this case, Option 2 seems to fit the riddle better.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?",They used translation tools or sought assistance from external sources.,"Tom is a math teacher, numbers are the same in French as they are in English.",The student are smart enough to rely on their prior konwledge to guess the homework answers.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""They used translation tools or sought assistance from external sources.""
This option is plausible. However, the riddle does not provide any information about the students having access to translation tools or external help. Therefore, this option is not the most likely answer.

Option 2: ""Tom is a math teacher, numbers are the same in French as they are in English.""
This option seems to be a bit off. The riddle mentions that Tom teaches in a Chinese school, not a French one. However, the idea that Tom is a math teacher and the numbers are universal could explain why the students were able to complete their assignments flawlessly. This option seems to be the most logical so far.

Option 3: ""The student are smart enough to rely on their prior knowledge to guess the homework answers.""
This option is also plausible. However, the riddle mentions that the students have not learned English yet. Therefore, it would be difficult for them to guess the answers based on prior knowledge. This option is not the most likely answer.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is always a possibility. However, based on the information provided in the riddle, option 2 seems to be the most logical answer.

Therefore, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 2'."
"If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?",Green.,Red.,White.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Green."" This option doesn't make sense because there's no mention of green in the riddle except for the spotlight, which doesn't relate to the shirt or the Red Sea.

Option 2: ""Red."" This might seem like the correct answer because of the name ""Red Sea."" However, the Red Sea's name doesn't mean that everything thrown into it turns red. It's just a name and doesn't have the power to change the color of objects.

Option 3: ""White."" This could be a possible answer if we consider that the shirt retains its original color. However, the riddle seems to imply a change, similar to the house and the spotlight.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This seems like the most logical answer. The riddle is about changes. The house changes color when painted, and the spotlight changes color. However, throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't change its color. It will likely just become wet.

So, the answer is 'Option 4'."
"You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why? ",All the people on the boat jump into the sea in a moment.,The boat is soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment.,"All the people on the boat are in relationships.
",None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""All the people on the boat jump into the sea in a moment."" This option seems unlikely as it would be difficult for all people to jump off the boat at the same time, especially without you noticing.

Option 2: ""The boat is soo big that all the people can hide themselves in a moment."" This option also seems unlikely as it would be difficult for all people to hide at the same time, especially without you noticing.

Option 3: ""All the people on the boat are in relationships."" This option might seem confusing at first, but it's actually the correct answer. The riddle says ""there is not a single person on the boat"", which can be interpreted as there are no single (unmarried or not in a relationship) people on the boat. This is a classic example of a riddle using double meanings to misdirect you.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because option 3 is the correct answer.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 3'."
"A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?",Two.,One.,Three.,None of above.,3,"Option 1: ""Two."" - If the fisherman caught two fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 = 40 fish. This is more than the 30 fish mentioned in the riddle.

Option 2: ""One."" - If the fisherman caught one fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 = 35 fish. This is more than the 30 fish mentioned in the riddle.

Option 3: ""Three."" - If the fisherman caught three fish on the first day and caught three more fish each day than the day before, the total number of fish caught would be 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45 fish. This is more than the 30 fish mentioned in the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - Since none of the first three options resulted in the fisherman catching 30 fish, this option must be the correct one.

So, the answer to the riddle is 'Option 4'."
Bob was working on a project when suddenly internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?,He needed a membership to search in google.,He searched the google in a wrong way.,The internet was disconnected so he couldn't search on google,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""He needed a membership to search in google."" This is not a correct answer because Google is a free search engine and does not require a membership to use.

Option 2: ""He searched the google in a wrong way."" This is also not a correct answer because the riddle does not provide any information about Bob searching Google incorrectly.

Option 3: ""The internet was disconnected so he couldn't search on google."" This seems to be the most logical answer. If the internet is disconnected, it would be impossible to search anything on Google.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct."" This is not a correct answer because Option 3 is a logical and correct answer.

So, the best and the most logical option is 'Option 3'."
"He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?",A teacher.,A preacher.,A laywer.,None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""A teacher."" - While a teacher may interact with numerous women, the phrase ""he has wed numerous women"" doesn't fit with the typical role of a teacher. Teachers educate, they don't perform wedding ceremonies. So, this option is unlikely.

Option 2: ""A preacher."" - A preacher, particularly in Christian contexts, often performs wedding ceremonies. In this role, they would ""wed"" or marry numerous women, but not to themselves. This fits the riddle's description well.

Option 3: ""A lawyer."" - A lawyer may work with numerous women, but they do not typically perform wedding ceremonies. So, this option doesn't fit the riddle's description.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" - This option would only be correct if none of the other options fit the riddle's description. However, as we've seen, Option 2 does fit the description.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 2'."
"You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed. How many legs are on the floor?","Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.","Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.","Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.",None of above.,1,"Option 1: ""Thirty-six, as there are eighteen animals.""
This option assumes that all animals are on the floor, but the riddle states that some animals are on the bed and some are flying. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 2: ""Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs.""
This option considers only the legs of the bed and your legs. It does not consider the legs of the animals on the floor. However, the riddle does not specify any animals on the floor. Therefore, this option is correct.

Option 3: ""Seventy-two, as there are eighteen animals.""
This option assumes that all animals are on the floor, but the riddle states that some animals are on the bed and some are flying. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct""
This option is incorrect because Option 2 is correct.

So, the answer is 'Option 2'."
"Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?",Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away.,Some daughters get married and have their own family.,Each daughter shares the same brother.,None of above.,2,"Option 1: ""Some brothers were not loved by family and moved away."" This option doesn't make sense because the riddle states that Mrs. Jones only has five kids. Whether the brothers moved away or not, they would still be counted as her children.

Option 2: ""Some daughters get married and have their own family."" This option also doesn't make sense because even if the daughters get married and have their own family, they are still Mrs. Jones' daughters. The number of her children wouldn't change.

Option 3: ""Each daughter shares the same brother."" This option makes sense. If Mrs. Jones has four daughters and they all share the same brother, that would make five children in total. This is the only option that fits the information given in the riddle.

Option 4: ""None of the above options are correct"" This option is incorrect because Option 3 is a valid solution to the riddle.

So, the best and most logical option is 'Option 3'."
