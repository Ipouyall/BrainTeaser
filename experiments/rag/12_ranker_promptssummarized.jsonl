The answer option suggests that the \"stones\" were actually seeds, specifically cherry seeds, which are often referred to as \"stones\". This explanation relies on the fact that cherry seeds, despite being called stones, are not hard or heavy enough to cause harm when thrown. They are significantly smaller and lighter than actual stones. Therefore, even if they hit the other farmer exactly as described in the question, they would not cause any harm.

The response to this question is a man pointing at the person who asked the question. This might seem confusing at first, as the use of \"you\" in English typically refers to the person being spoken to. However, the answer option provides a clever twist to this scenario.

What made the hiker suspicious of the man?\"\nAnswer: \"If he had genuinely taken the wrong trail, he would have been more likely to ask for directions or consult a map.\"\nExplanation: \"The man's behavior, combined with his sudden appearance from the bushes and lack of seeking further assistance, arouses the hiker's suspicion and makes his decision to take precautionary measures seem justified.\"\n", "shot 2": "Riddle: \"The more you take, the more you abandon.\"\nAnswer: \"Footsteps.\"\nExplanation: \"The question is a riddle that requires a metaphorical answer. The phrase \"The more you take, the more you abandon\" refers to an action that leaves something behind as it is performed more. When you take a step, you leave a footprint behind.

The answer option suggests that the \"stones\" were actually seeds, specifically cherry seeds, which are often referred to as \"stones\". This explanation relies on the fact that cherry seeds, despite being called stones, are not hard or heavy enough to cause harm when thrown.

The answer option suggests that she is a business owner with 60 employees. The two words she writes could be her first and last name, which she signs on their paychecks. The frequency of her action, every two weeks, aligns with a common pay period in many businesses, which is bi-weekly.

Therefore, even if he goes outside in the rain, there would be no hair to get wet.

The answer option suggests that this is because ducks can't read. This is a logical explanation as ducks, being non-human animals, do not possess the cognitive ability to understand human languages or symbols. Therefore, a duck would not be able to comprehend the meaning of a \"No swimming allowed\" sign. It would not know that the sign is instructing it to refrain from entering the water.

Therefore, even without any form of protection from the rain, a bald man would not have any hair on his head get wet because there is no hair to begin with. \"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th.

How's that possible?\"\nAnswer: \"The name of the man who was asking the question was You\"\nExplanation: \"The question describes a scenario where a man is asking someone \"where is you?\". The response to this question is a man pointing at the person who asked the question. This might seem confusing at first, as the use of \"you\" in English typically refers to the person being spoken to. However, the answer option provides a clever twist to this scenario. It suggests that the man who was asking the question is actually named \"You\". Therefore, when the other man points at him in response to the question, he is indicating that the person named \"You\" is the one asking the question.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"Jimy went in the middle of the warzone and bombarded a lot of territories that were in the possession of the enemy.

Why?\"\nAnswer: \"Jimy was the name of the fighter-jet that was flying over enemy's territory.\"\nExplanation: \"The answer option reveals that Jimy is not a person, but the name of a fighter-jet. Medals and praises are typically given to individuals or groups of people for their bravery or achievements. Inanimate objects, such as a fighter-jet, do not receive such accolades, regardless of their role in successful military operations. Therefore, the lack of recognition for Jimy is due to the fact that it is a machine, not a human.\"\n"}

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.\"\nExplanation: \"The question describes a situation where a farmer throws a handful of \"stones\" at another farmer, but the latter remains unharmed. The answer option suggests that the \"stones\" were actually seeds, specifically cherry seeds, which are often referred to as \"stones\". This explanation relies on the fact that cherry seeds, despite being called stones, are not hard or heavy enough to cause harm when thrown. They are significantly smaller and lighter than actual stones. Therefore, even if they hit the other farmer exactly as described in the question, they would not cause any harm. This is why the other farmer was unharmed despite being hit by the \"stones\".\"\n", "shot 2": "Riddle: \"I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit.

The seed of a cherry is called a stone.\"\nExplanation: \"The correct answer is specifically referring to a cherry seed, which is often called a \"stone\" due to its hard exterior.

Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay.

The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible?\"\nAnswer: \"Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.\"\nExplanation: \"The truck's weight decreases as it uses up its fuel to travel the half mile, offsetting the bird's weight added on the truck, preventing the bridge from collapsing.\"\n"}

This seems contradictory at first, but the answer option suggests that the woman is a surrogate mother. However, this answer is incorrect because a surrogate mother is a woman who becomes pregnant usually by artificial insemination or surgical implantation of a fertilized egg for the purpose of carrying the fetus to term for another woman or couple.

Why weren't they seated?\"\nAnswer: \"The man saw a committee chair and not an actual chair\"\nExplanation: \"The observer entering a hall and finding everyone standing despite a chair in the corner is confusing.

This might seem contradictory at first, as in a traditional chess game between two players, only one can win. However, the answer option provides a plausible explanation: \"They were playing against other opponents.\" This means that the two individuals were not playing against each other, but each was playing a separate game against a different opponent.

This seems contradictory at first, but the answer option suggests that the woman is a surrogate mother. However, this answer is incorrect because a surrogate mother is a woman who becomes pregnant usually by artificial insemination or surgical implantation of a fertilized egg for the purpose of carrying the fetus to term for another woman or couple.

In an orphanage, children are typically under the care of the institution because they have lost their parents or their parents are unable to care for them.

One father said, that is enough for all of us, we will have one each. How can this be possible?\"\nAnswer: \"There was the father, his son, and his son's son.\"\nExplanation: \"The riddle plays with the concept of familial relationships and challenges our typical understanding of \"two fathers and two sons.\" The answer explains that the two fathers are the grandfather and the father, and the two sons are the father and the son, meaning there are only three individuals involved.
