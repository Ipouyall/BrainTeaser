If ostriches are known for their ability to fly, this would be a simple math problem of subtracting flying ostriches from the initial amount.

What made the hiker suspicious of the man?\"\nAnswer: \"If he had genuinely taken the wrong trail, he would have been more likely to ask for directions or consult a map.\"\nExplanation: \"The man's behavior is incongruent with what a genuine lost hiker would do, and his odd actions trigger the hiker's suspicion.\"\n", "shot 2": "Riddle: \"The more you take, the more you abandon.\"\nAnswer: \"Footsteps.\"\nExplanation: \"The question requires a metaphorical answer and footsteps can be interpreted as taking something (action) and abandoning (footprint).\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"Rain began to fall as Samuel was taking a stroll.

Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg.

However, the riddle only intends to mislead with these details, and the solution is quite simple once these distractions are ignored. The question does not imply that the camels cannot move at all, only that they cannot move their heads. Therefore, the most logical first step is to assume that the two camels can see each other without moving since the question does not specify that they cannot see each other without moving their heads.

The other four men could have sped up to get to shelter but then waited indefinitely until the fifth man's coffin arrived, explaining how they all arrived at the same place at the same time.

However, there were some tall trees that could've survived them.

This contradiction reveals that the answer is none of the above.\"\n"}

It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step?\"\nAnswer: \"Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.\"\nExplanation: \"The question is framed in a manner that directs attention towards the possibility of a fatal fall from the balcony.

Why?\"\nAnswer: \"The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.\"\nExplanation: \"The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor, which is why he had to plan his days based on the weather.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"One day, a thirty-story building was on fire.

He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible?\"\nAnswer: \"He lived in a light house.\"\nExplanation: \"This suggests an association between the act of turning off the lights and the fatal consequence of 365 deaths. This leverages the double meaning of the word 'lights' in the context of lighting fixtures and also indicators of safety or alert. This is supported by the fact that lighthouses are usually located near the sea, and their purpose is to guide ships safely at night. Thus, by turning off the lights of the lighthouse, the man unknowingly put the ships at risk, resulting in the death of 365 people.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"A one-story home at the intersection of the street had bedrooms painted yellow, a kitchen painted orange, a living room painted red, a garage painted blue, an entryway painted green, and a sitting room painted purple.

The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.

He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there.

Both the horse and the tower are fine.

How many pigeons are left for the tiger to eat?\"\nAnswer: \"None of above.\"\nExplanation: \"This question is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to definitively answer with one of the options provided. The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.  Thus, the logical path from question to answer is that each option is eliminated due to insufficient information.\"\n", "shot 2": "Riddle: \"A chopper had ten pigeons inside and threw all of them out to die. However, there were some tall trees that could've survived them.
