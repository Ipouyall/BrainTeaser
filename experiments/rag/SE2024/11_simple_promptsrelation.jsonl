If ostriches are known for their ability to fly, this would be a simple math problem of subtracting flying ostriches from the initial amount.

Can you explain?\"\nAnswer: \"When he is on the camel he omits to count it.\"\nExplanation: \"The discrepancy in the peasant's counting occurs either due to the presence or absence of the camel he is riding on.

But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?\"\n\nThe relevant sentence here is: \"Each daughter shares the same brother.\"\n\nThis shows that each of the six daughters has the same brother, meaning that the brother is a sibling to all of them, and not individually. \n\nThis means that the six daughters have a total of one brother, bringing the total number of people in the family to nine. \n\nTherefore, there is no confusion, and 11 is the correct answer, as this is the total number of people in the family, with six daughters, one brother, and two parents.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window.

Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg.

If four of them take off flying, how many are left in the field?\"\nAnswer: \"None of above.\"\nExplanation: \"This is a common riddle relying on irony. If ostriches are known for their ability to fly, this would be a simple math problem of subtracting flying ostriches from the initial amount.

The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.

Can you elaborate?\"\nAnswer: \"When he is on the camel he omits to count it.\"\nExplanation: \"The riddle suggests that the peasant is counting the camels inaccurately, and the hypothesis provides a specific explanation for this inaccuracy: the peasant is excluding the camel he is riding on in his count when he is seated, and includes it when he counts while dismounted.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"How can you leave a room with two legs and return with six legs?\"\nAnswer: \"Bring a chair back with you.\"\nExplanation: \"The riddle prompts you to realize that legs can also refer to the legs of a chair, which adds another layer to the meaning of the word.

He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible?\"\nAnswer: \"He lived in a light house.\"\nExplanation: \"This suggests an association between the act of turning off the lights and the fatal consequence of 365 deaths. This leverages the double meaning of the word 'lights' in the context of lighting fixtures and also indicators of safety or alert. This is supported by the fact that lighthouses are usually located near the sea, and their purpose is to guide ships safely at night. Thus, by turning off the lights of the lighthouse, the man unknowingly put the ships at risk, resulting in the death of 365 people.\"\n", "shot 3": "Riddle: \"In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed.

How does Sally deal with this issue?\"\nAnswer: \"She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.\n\"\nExplanation: \"This suggests that Sally is aware that the lake freezes over in the winter months and that the ice will support her weight.

The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.

The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible?\"\nAnswer: \"I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.\"\nExplanation: \"As the narrator is the one telling the story, they must be the person who has not been caught by the police.

He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on?\"\nAnswer: \"George walked down the stairs.

With the information provided, the only way to separate the fighting children without touching each other is to interpose the door between them.

How many pigeons are left for the tiger to eat?\"\nAnswer: \"None of above.\"\nExplanation: \"This question is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to definitively answer with one of the options provided. The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.

However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible?\"\nAnswer: \"Each daughter shares the same brother.\"\nExplanation: \"The question states that each of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard's six daughters has one brother, leading one to think that there are six brothers for each daughter. This would result in a total of 14 people in the family. However, the question also states that there are only nine people in the family.

They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet?\"\nAnswer: \"Because it was not raining.\"\nExplanation: \"The umbrella is assumed to be used for protection from rain, however the question does not confirm that it is actually raining.

This leverages the double meaning of the word 'lights' in the context of lighting fixtures and also indicators of safety or alert. This is supported by the fact that lighthouses are usually located near the sea, and their purpose is to guide ships safely at night.
