I was in my kitchen, looking out at the bird feeder, and there he was. I had to remind myself that this was indeed a turkey. He looked more like a large dark brown bird with white highlights and red wattles. He was not at all like the pictures of a tom turkey with his tail spread and head up in full strut.\n\nThis bird seemed to know that I knew he was not supposed to be there. After all, I had just finished telling my husband that I had seen a flock of turkeys at the end of our lane that same afternoon. I was proud of myself for this sighting. It was early April and spring turkey hunting was in full swing. My husband was out hunting that afternoon.\n\nThe bird on my porch did not look like a turkey that was out looking for a mate. He looked like a bird that was lost. I assumed he must have been chased out of a nesting area by a mother hen and was now looking for a place to hide. He seemed very content just standing there looking back at me through the window. He did not seem to be in a hurry to leave. I did not want to startle him, so I just watched him. He watched me back.\n\nAs the days passed, the wild turkey became a daily visitor. He would arrive about the same time each evening. He seemed to be looking for a place to roost. The only place he could find cover was under the porch. He would spend the entire night there. I would not see him again until the next evening when he came out to go in search of food.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor until the middle of May. I did not see him again until late July. He returned each year about the same time and spent about a month with us. I assumed that he was a young tom that had wandered away from his family. His wild instincts seemed to take over when he left. He was not content to just stay in the safety of his family group.\n\nOne year, he brought a friend. They were both wild young toms. They seemed to enjoy each other's company. They would come in the morning and go to roost in the evening. It was obvious that they were not content to be alone.\n\nI enjoyed having the wild turkeys visit, but I did not want them to become tame. It is against the law to feed wildlife. I wanted them to remain wild. They were not getting any benefit from their visits other than a place to stay dry. I did not provide any food or water for them.\n\nI assumed that when hunting season came, my wild guests would leave. This was not the case. The wild turkeys continued to visit during hunting season. They were not at all bothered by the hunters. The hunters seemed to be more interested in the wild birds than the wild turkeys.\n\nOne year, we had a heavy ice storm that knocked out the power. The power was out for several days. I had a full freezer and a half tank of gas for my generator. I did not want to use my generator unless I absolutely had to because the noise would disturb my wild guests. I was able to keep the food in my freezer cold for several days by wrapping it in blankets. I was also able to keep some of the food cold by placing it in a cooler with ice.\n\nThe wild turkeys continued to visit during the ice storm even though they could not roost under the porch because there was no place for them to roost due to the ice. They seemed content to just stand there in the snow.\n\nOne year, the wild turkeys continued to visit during the ice storm even though they could not roost under the porch because there was no place for them to roost due to the ice. They seemed content to just stand there in the snow.\n\nOne evening, a wild turkey came to my back door. He was tapping on the window with his beak. He wanted in. I could not allow him to come in because I did not want him to become tame. I opened the door and he came in. I immediately closed the door behind him. He seemed to understand that he was not supposed to be in the house. He just stood there looking at me. I did not want to startle him or chase him back outside because I did not want him to become aggressive. I just stood there looking at him. He looked up at me and seemed to understand that he was not supposed to be in the house. He turned around and walked back out the door. I immediately closed the door behind him.\n\nI have had wild turkeys visit me for over ten years. They seem to know that this is a place where they are safe. I do not want to lose their friendship by providing them with food or water or by disturbing them in any way. I want them to remain wild.\n\nThe passage above describes the behavior of a wild turkey, which is a bird that is not typically kept as a pet. The author emphasizes that it is illegal to feed wildlife, and wants to avoid turning the turkey into a domesticated bird. Based on this information, can you reason where a domestic turkey, raised for consumption, is more likely to be found?\n\nOption 1: \"back porch\"\nOption 2: \"countryside\"\nOption 3: \"cage\"\nOptional 4: \"sky\"\nOption 5: \"windowsill\"\n\no now, the time's up.

Today's session will include a group activity to help you understand the difference between nouns and pronouns. In a group, you are required to discuss the difference between these two parts of speech and then present your findings in front of the class. Each group has 10 minutes to prepare their presentation. After that, you will present your findings. Let's start with group 1.\n\n[15:35]\n\n[Student's Name]\n\no good morning. Today we will explain to you the difference between nouns and pronouns. First, let's talk about nouns. Nouns are names of people, places, things, animals, and ideas. Some examples of nouns include 'table,' 'chair,' 'dog,' and 'book.' Now let's move on to pronouns. Pronouns take the place of nouns to save time and avoid repetition. For example, instead of saying 'the girl is eating an apple,' we say'she is eating the apple.' Pronouns can be personal, possessive, and reflexive. That's all from group 1.\n\n[15:55]\n\n[Teacher's Name]\n\no great explanation. Thank you, group 1, for your presentation. Let's move on to group 2. Group 2, please present your understanding of nouns and pronouns.\n\n[16:10]\n\n[Student's Name]\n\no good afternoon. Today we will be discussing nouns and pronouns. Nouns can be classified into several types, including proper nouns, common nouns, and collective nouns. Proper nouns are the names of specific persons, places, or things, such as John, London, and the sun. Common nouns are the names of general persons, places, or things, such as boy, house, and car. Collective nouns refer to a group of people or things, such as team, family, and crowd.\n\nNow, let's move on to pronouns. Pronouns are used instead of nouns to make a sentence more concise. For instance, instead of writing 'the boy is eating an apple,' we can write 'he is eating the apple.' Pronouns are also of different types, such as personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, and reflexive pronouns. Personal pronouns represent people or animals, such as 'I,' 'you,' 'he,''she,' and 'it.' Possessive pronouns indicate ownership, such as'my,' 'your,' 'his,' 'her,' and 'its.' Reflexive pronouns are used as a subject as well as an object, such as'myself,' 'yourself,' 'himself,' 'herself,' and 'itself.'\n\nThat's all from group 2. Thank you for your presentation.\n\n[16:25]\n\n[Teacher's Name]\n\no thank you, both groups, for your presentations. Today we learned about the differences between nouns and pronouns. Remember, nouns name specific and general things, while pronouns are used to replace nouns in sentences. Keep learning, and we'll see you next time.

It's necessary to apply the disinfectant regularly, preferably after the patient's discharge, as the hospital environment is prone to harboring germs that can spread infections to other patients. However, the frequency of applying the disinfectant may vary based on the patient's diagnosis and other risk factors.

Bacteria are single-celled living organisms that have their own DNA and can survive without being attached to a host cell. They can reproduce through binary fission, where a single bacterium divides into two daughter cells. Viruses, on the other hand, are nonliving entities that can't reproduce on their own but require a host cell to replicate. They are much smaller than bacteria and consist of genetic material enclosed in a protein coat. Viruses enter a host cell, take over its machinery, and replicate their own genetic material, eventually destroying the host cell in the process.
