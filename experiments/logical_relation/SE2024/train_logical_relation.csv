SP-0,"Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?",Each daughter shares the same brother.,"The question is mainly confused about the fact of having six daughters and each of them having one brother. It creates a confusion initially that there would be six brothers in total but that would not fit the given situation that the family is just about 9 people. So, each daughter shares the same brother and has to be the logical answer to the question."
SP-0_SR,"The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible?",Each daughter shares the same brother.,"The question states that each of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard's six daughters has one brother, leading one to think that there are six brothers for each daughter. This would result in a total of 14 people in the family. However, the question also states that there are only nine people in the family. This leads to the conclusion that each daughter shares the same brother, meaning there is only one brother who is a sibling to all six daughters. "
SP-0_CR,"A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?",Each player shares the same coach.,"The question states that there are five players and one coach, but there's a contradiction that there are only six participants. The logical connection to the answer is that having five players share the same coach (meaning there is only one coach) would result in only six members in total, thus resolving the contradiction and aligning with the given answer."
SP-1,"A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be?","The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.","The answer option offers a new interpretation of the verbs used in the riddle, suggesting alternative, non-violent actions related to the woman's occupation as a photographer."
SP-1_SR,"An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case?","The woman was a photographer.

SP-2,"Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen?",This man is bald.,The only way the clothes getting wetd but the hair dry is if Samuel is bald.
SP-2_SR,"Rain began to fall as Samuel was taking a stroll. He wasn't wearing a hat, and he didn't have an umbrella. Even though his clothes were completely drenched, not a single hair on his head was moist. How is this even possible?",This man is bald.,"The only way his hair stays dry is if he is bald, since the rain has no hair to soak."
SP-2_CR,Tom is a clean freak but he never dries his hair after a shower. How is this possible?,This man is bald.,"The answer encompasses a deduction revolving around the concept of resolving contradiction. The inherent paradox between Tom's cleanliness and his not drying his hair after a shower is resolved by factoring in the circumstance of Tom being bald. This insight allows for a coherent understanding of both aspects, making the answer sensible and consistent within the context of the riddle."
SP-5,"Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five girls so that each girl gets an apple, but one apple remains in the basket?",Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.,This clever solution satisfies the conditions set out in the question.
SP-5_SR,"There are five apples in a basket. You distribute them among the five girls, giving each one an apple while leaving one apple in the basket. How is that even doable?",Give the fifth girl her apple in the basket.,Understand that giving each girl an apple while leaving one apple in the basket is possible by giving the entire basket to the fifth girl.
SP-5_CR,"There is a peculiar vase holding seven magical beans. You must distribute these beans among seven sorcerers, ensuring each one gets a bean, but still leaving one bean in the vase. How could this enchanting scenario occur?",Hand over the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase.,"This riddle sets up a paradox where both giving away and retaining one bean simultaneously seems impossible. The answer turns this paradox on its head by giving away the final bean, thereby retaining the last bean in the vase."
SP-6,Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this?,"Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.","This clever riddle tests our ability to think outside the box. With the information provided, the only way to separate the fighting children without touching each other is to interpose the door between them. The riddle leads us to the solution through the description of the siblings' conflict and the mother's creative punishment, setting the stage for the unexpected sliding-door answer."
SP-6_SR,"Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this?","Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.","This clever solution leverages the physical dimensions of a door and a sheet of newspaper to separate the arguing siblings, satisfying the conditions of the riddle's premise."" 

I hope this short analysis demonstrates the logical connection between the question, answer, and my hypothesis. Let me know if you would like me to refine this response further or provide any additional clarity."
SP-6_CR,"A couple is having a disagreement over the man's error. The man kept apologizing and pleading with the woman to allow him to see her directly. The woman was still upset. Thus, she wouldn't agree. The couple, though, was positioned on the same mat. How is that even doable?","The couple was standing on two sides of the girl's apartment door, which had a rug under it.",This scenario allows for the woman's refusal to see the man and their positioning on the same mat to coexist.
SP-7,"A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.
How is this possible?",The rope is not tied to anything else.,The horse can freely move around with the rope and reach the hay that is ten meters away.
SP-7_SR,"In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope.Â How is that even possible?",The rope is not tied to anything else.,"The question's phrasing might lead one to assume that the rope restricts the horse's movement, but the answer option clarifies that this is not the case.""

SP-7_CR,"If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?",The station wasn't fixed in the marina,"The riddle suggests that the boat was properly tied to a station in the marina. However, the key detail is that the station was not securely fixed or anchored in the marina, allowing it to drift away. This single piece of information provides the explanation for the boat's location in the middle of the ocean."
SP-8,"All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible?",Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.,"The logical relation is that Mrs. Smith has one pet that is a cat (the one that is not a dog) and one pet that is a dog (the one that is not a cat), which totals to two pets, fulfilling the condition of the question."
SP-8_SR,"All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets?",Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog.,"The key to solving this riddle is in understanding the contradiction posed by the question. The statement suggests Mrs. Smith has at least one dog and at least one cat, which seemingly suggests a total of at least three pets. However, the riddle states she only has two pets. This contradiction is resolved by realizing Mrs. Smith has one dog and one cat, meaning both conditions from the question are fulfilled."
SP-8_CR,"All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible?",Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car.,It is the only possible logical relation of the riddle.
SP-9,"The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America had the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible?",They were the same man.,"The only way this can be true is if the two presidents were the same man, who had the same parents but was not regarded as the brother of himself."
SP-9_SR,"Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable?",They were the same man.,The unique status of Grover Cleveland as a two-term president creates a counterintuitive situation where he simultaneously occupies the positions of the 22nd and 24th presidents. This circumstance challenges the straightforward assumption that they were related and requires an explanation where these presidents are in fact the same individual.
SP-9_CR,"The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible?",They were the same man.,"The answer resolves the paradox presented in the question by suggesting a single individual coached the two champion teams, thus sharing the same parents without involving any siblings."
SP-10,There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet?,Because it was not raining.,"The umbrella is assumed to be used for protection from rain, however the question does not confirm that it is actually raining. Therefore, the absence of rain as stated in the answer is logically consistent with the given scenario."
SP-10_SR,Eight girls attended the school. They were using the same umbrella. Why did none of the females get wet?,Because it was not raining.,"The absence of rain means there is no precipitation, and hence no source of wetness for the girls."
SP-10_CR,"Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible?",It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.,"The explanation offers a reasonable resolution by highlighting the time of year and the absence of leaves on the tree, making the situation free of any contradiction."
SP-11,A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a power failure caused by a storm. A car with two broken headlights drives towards the dog but turns in time to avoid hitting him. How could the driver have seen the dog in time?,It was during the daylight hours.,"Despite the painted black town and lack of artificial lights, the riddle suggests that it was still possible for the driver to see the dog. The only plausible scenario is that it was during the daytime, and the answer option indicates this."
SP-11_SR,"A town that has been painted black has a black dog standing in the midst of an intersection. Due to a storm-related power outage, none of the street lights are functioning. When a car with two broken headlights approaches the dog, it turns away in time to miss him.

SP-11_CR,"Within Joshua Tree National Park, a couple is driving. Because there is no light in the area to improve the view, the Joshua Tree National area is well known for its starry sky. The couple travels here for the first time, and the roads are rough. Their vehicle's headlights are damaged. How did they manage to prevent being crushed?",It was during the daylight hours.,They managed to see and navigate the rough roads due to the natural light provided by the sun.
SP-12,On a fine sunny day a ship was in the harbor. All of a sudden the ship began to sink. There was no storm and nothing wrong with the ship yet it sank right in front of the spectators eyes. What caused the ship to sink?,It was a Submarine.,"The only vessel that can sink on a sunny day without any external interference is a submarine, and its normal operations involve submerging and sinking."
SP-12_SR,The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking?,It was a Submarine.,"The unusual phenomenon of a ship sinking without any storm or mechanical issues is resolved by the unique nature of submarines, which are designed to submerge and sink in water, explaining the absence of any external causes for the sinking."
SP-12_CR,"The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why?",It was a Submarine.,"This highlights the double meaning in the question, as the ship sinking is not a threat to a submarine and its crew, who are accustomed to diving actions."
SP-13,"A man who lived on the top floor of a twenty story building had to go up and down daily for work, and of course, for food and the other necessities. On most days he could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story, and he would have to walk the rest of the way. When it rained, however, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story. Why?","The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.","The only way to explain why the man's behavior is that he isn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th story, but when it rains he brings an umbrella to press the button for the 20th story."
SP-13_SR,"A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements. He could only use the elevator up to the fifteenth story most days, after which he had to continue walking. However, he could ride all the way to the twentieth storey when it poured. Why?","The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the 15th story button on the elevator. When it rained, he brought his umbrella, and used it to press the 20th story button on the elevator.","The man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor, which is why he had to plan his days based on the weather."
SP-13_CR,A man uses the elevator since he is too old to use his crutch to ascend to the 12th floor. He is asked to hit the 17th button by a woman who is taller than him because she is unable to do it herself. Why?,The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch.,The old man can reach the button with the help of his crutch but the taller woman cannot.
SP-15,"Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not?",Penguins only live in Antarctica.,"This highlights the fact that the absence of penguins and their eggs in the Arctic is not due to some cultural or culinary preference, but simply because penguins are naturally found in a different part of the world."
SP-15_SR,"Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not?",Penguins only live in Antarctica.,"Arctic Natives don't eat penguin eggs because penguins are native to Antarctica not the Arctic, so accessing penguin eggs would be incredibly challenging."

One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife?","The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.","The question states that the wizard brought the woman to her house at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. This suggests that the night visit interrupted the regular schedule of the wizard. This is important because it implies that the only overnight interruption was when the wizard brought the woman to her house. Thus, the husband realized that the rose bush without dew was the one who went inside the house with the wizard. With this information, the husband was able to rescue his wife."
SP-17_SR,"There was once a bad wizard. He abducted three women from their homes and transformed them into identical rose plants. They were placed in his garden. One of the women pleaded with the magician to allow her to see her husband and kids. He concurred. He took the woman to her home at night. He arrived early in the morning and drove her home. The spouse made the decision to go get her one day. He entered the wizard's garden as a result. He kept glancing at the three identical rose bushes, trying to determine which one might be his wife. He took his wife home as soon as he realized the solution. How did he recognize his wife among the rosebushes?","The wizard brought the rosebush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.","The husband noticed the absence of dew on one of the rosebushes and reasoned that it must be because that plant had been taken inside a building overnight, missing the dew formation process."
SP-17_CR,"Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How?","There are no dew on the raddishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning.","The absence of dew on the radishes contradicts the farmer's claim of harvesting them that morning, likely raising suspicion and leading to his detention by the police."
SP-18,There are 3 apples for 2 sons and 2 fathers to eat. Each of them get their own apple. How is it numerically possible?,"They are one son, one father and one grandfather.","The numerical discrepancy is resolved by considering the relationship between the four people, which allows for the distribution of three apples."
SP-18_SR,There are 3 apples available for 2 fathers and 2 boys to consume. They each receive a single apple. How is it a mathematical possibility?,"They are one son, one father and one grandfather.","The answer option suggests a reinterpretation of the situation in which there are actually only three individuals, rather than four. This solves the problem of distributing the three apples in a way that is mathematically consistent with the information in the question."
SP-18_CR,"Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why?","They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.","The three forms are for the grandmother, the mother (who is also a daughter), and the granddaughter (who is also a daughter)"

The next morning he killed 365 people, he does not sleep walk he slept like a baby. How could this be?",He lived in a light house.,"This is a play on words, lighthouses emit light, but this riddle is also referring to the word sleep, as light sleep and deep sleep are both terms associated with sleeping babies."
SP-20_SR,"After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible?",He lived in a light house.,"This suggests an association between the act of turning off the lights and the fatal consequence of 365 deaths. This leverages the double meaning of the word 'lights' in the context of lighting fixtures and also indicators of safety or alert. This is supported by the fact that lighthouses are usually located near the sea, and their purpose is to guide ships safely at night. Thus, by turning off the lights of the lighthouse, the man unknowingly put the ships at risk, resulting in the death of 365 people."
SP-20_CR,"Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain?",He lived in a light house.,"The man's unusual sleeping habit is justified and understood when it is realized that he lives in a lighthouse, making such a bright light normal and acceptable in that context, and furthermore, distancing the reason for no complaints from potential neighbors."
SP-21,"Joe and Sally were sitting in their family room one night. While Joe was watching T.V, his wife Sally was reading. All of a sudden the power went out and Joe decided to go to bed, but Sally kept on reading. With no use of artificial light, Sally kept on reading.

The moment the electricity went out, Joe made the decision to retire to bed, but Sally continued to read. Sally carried on reading without using any artificial lighting. How?","Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.","Sally's unusual ability to continue reading without artificial lighting can be logically explained by her utilizing Braille, a system designed for individuals who are blind."
SP-21_CR,"Jessica will read the Bible every night before bed. Jessica had forgotten to buy candles for a backup one day when the electricity went out, but she stillÂ read a chapter before turning in. How is that even doable?","Sally was blind, she was reading a book by Braille.","Braille doesnt require candles as its possible to read it with fingers""

SP-22_SR,The tennis match involved two men. Each man won three sets in the five that were played. How is this even conceivable?,The two men were partners playing doubles.,"This riddle might initially confuse you by stating that each man won three sets, which seems inconsistent with the idea of a singles match. But the resolution to the puzzle is that they were playing doubles, where partnerships work differently, and each man winning three sets is entirely possible."
SP-22_CR,Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible?,The four people were playing in two teams of two each. Each team won twice.,"This option provides the only feasible explanation that aligns with the provided riddle.

SP-23,"A simple peasant bought a number of camels and is taking them to his farm. As he rides contentedly along he counts them - he counts 29. He was sure he had bought 30 camel, so in alarm he jumps off his camel and counts the camels again. To his delight there are 30. Half an hour later, he counts his camels and once more there are just 29. Confused, he climbs off his camel and counts again. Once more there are 30. Can you explain?",When he is on the camel he omits to count it.,"The discrepancy in the peasant's counting occurs either due to the presence or absence of the camel he is riding on. When riding, the camel is unaccounted for, thus the discrepancy of 29 camels. Alighting and counting includes the camel he sat on, resulting in a count of 30."
SP-23_SR,"A common peasant recently purchased many camels and is transporting them to his land. He counts them as he travels happily and finds that there are 29 of them. He leaps off his camel in fright after thinking he had purchased 30 camels and counts them once more. He is delighted to find 30. He counts his camels again thirty minutes later, and this time there are only 29. He dismounts his camel in confusion and counts once more. There are 30 once more. Can you elaborate?",When he is on the camel he omits to count it.,"The riddle suggests that the peasant is counting the camels inaccurately, and the hypothesis provides a specific explanation for this inaccuracy: the peasant is excluding the camel he is riding on in his count when he is seated, and includes it when he counts while dismounted."
SP-23_CR,"Each of the 30 participants in the masquerade had to wear a unique hat to distinguish themselves from one another. The host, however, only tallied 29 when he counted the number of hats to determine attendance. All 30 persons had signed their names on the spreadsheet, which confused him. He repeated the count. There are still 29. How is that even doable?",The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it.,"The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it."" weighs against
""Initially, you might think there is a missing hat and a missing participant"
SP-24,One day a little boy named John went over to his parents and said that he wanted to shoot people and blow them up. His parents were really proud of his career choice. keep in mind that his parents were not very violent people. Why?,John wanted to be a photographer.,"John's statement about wanting to shoot people and blow them up can be understood as metaphors related to photography, explaining the unexpected pride of his non-violent parents."
SP-24_SR,"When John, a young child, told his parents he intended to shoot and blow up people, they were shocked. His parents were really happy with his professional decision. Remember, his parents weren't exactly aggressive folks. Why?",John wanted to be a photographer.,Understanding the double meaning of the phrases 'shoot' and 'blow up' in the context of photography resolves the seeming incongruence between John's statement and his parents' reaction.
SP-24_CR,"When Laura, a bright young girl, shared with her parents that she intended to slice, dice, and gut for a living, they were taken aback. However, they quickly expressed their excitement for her future career. Keep in mind, her parents were not particularly violent people.

SP-25,"Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall?","Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.","The answer option introduces a metaphorical twist by implying that Brad was so tired of window washing that he literally jumped inside the building through the window, which negates the need to explain how he survived a fall from such a height."
SP-25_SR,"Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?","Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.","The answer option reveals that Brad was a window washer outside the building, providing a completely different perspective on the situation."
SP-25_CR,"Lily stood on the edge of the 18th floor of the high-rise apartment complex. Overwhelmed with fatigue, she opened the balcony door and stepped through. It was a steep drop from the balcony to the pavement below. Amazingly, after stepping, she was unscathed. Given that there was nothing to soften her landing or slow her descent, how could she have survived the step?","Lily was exhausted from apartment cleaning, she opened the balcony door and stepped inside.","The question is framed in a manner that directs attention towards the possibility of a fatal fall from the balcony. However, upon revisiting the scenario, it is noted that the question mentions fatigue and the subsequent lack of harm to Lily. This discrepancy is resolved by considering the alternative interpretation that Lily stepped inside the balcony, not off of it."
SP-26,A horse jumps over a tower and the tower disappears. It's not an illusion or a dream. So where could this happen?,On a chessboard.,"The question requires critical thinking beyond the immediate literal interpretation, as the scenario described is impossible in the real world. The clue that points to the solution is the mention of absence of illusion or dream, implying a logical or intellectual realm. Chess known as a game of strategy fits this criterion, where pieces interact on a unique and abstract way. The horse (knight) jumping over the tower (rook) and 'disappearing' is a representation of the unique way the knight piece moves and captures opponents piece on the chessboard. Therefore, the logical connection leads to the answer 'on a chessboard'."
SP-26_SR,"A tower is jumped over by a horse, and the tower vanishes. It's not a dream or an illusion. So where might this occur?",On a chessboard.,The only place you can jump over a tower and make it vanish without any illusion or dream is on a chessboard where a knight can jump over a rook (tower) and remove it from the game.
SP-26_CR,"A tower suddenly moves directly to another tower, and the tower hitted vanishes. It's not a dream or an illusion. So where might this occur? ",On a chessboard.,"The only place you can have a moving tower that vanishes another tower is on a chessboard, where rooks are moved to capture opponents' pieces.""

SP-27,"Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If sheâs not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions?",Dorothy is a sky jumper.,"While Dorothy's behavior may initially seem concerning from the perspective of someone who might jump to the conclusion that she is suicidal, the given scenario about a person named Dorothy does not necessarily imply suicidal tendencies. Instead, the information provided about her arranging trips to high spots and jumping from them, coupled with the absence of injuries or death, points towards a speculative conclusion: Dorothy is a sky jumper. This sports activity aligns with the given context and explains the described behavior, particularly concerning the sensation of relief after the jumps."
SP-27_SR,"Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal?",Dorothy is a sky jumper.,The question wants us to understand Dorothy's behavior without resorting to the misconception of suicide ideas. The hypothesis avoids this misconception by suggesting that Dorothy is engaged in the sport of sky jumping. This nuanced understanding allows us to explain her behavior without associating it with suicidal tendencies.
SP-27_CR,"Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself?",Matthew is a deep-sea diver.,"The answer option provides a plausible explanation that aligns with the observations stated in the riddle. It introduces the idea that Matthew is a deep-sea diver, possessing the necessary training and expertise to engage in this activity in a safe manner. This insight reframes his actions as a calculated and purposeful endeavor, transforming the seemingly suicidal tendencies into a relieving and rejuvenating activity. Thus, the logical connection between the hypothesis and the riddle hinges upon the interpretation of Matthew's actions as those of a seasoned deep-sea diver, safeguarding him from harm and eliciting a sense of tranquility.""

SP-28,"A certain large animal lives happily and thrives here on Earth. One day, every single one of these writers is wiped out by a mysterious disease that affects only this particular animal. There are none left anywhere on earth -- they are all gone. About a year or so later, they begin to reappear on Earth again. How can this be?","The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.","The key to solving this riddle is to understand that Mules, although appearing like a large animal, are infertile and cannot reproduce on their own. This infertile nature explains the reappearance of Mules on Earth, even after a disease wiped them out."
SP-28_SR,"Here on Earth, a certain big animal prospers and lives happily. One day, a mystery disease that solely affects this unique species annihilates each and every one of these writers. They are all gone; there are none remaining everywhere on earth. They start to reappear on Earth again a year or so later. How is this possible?","The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.",The breeding behaviour of mules makes it a unique species. This explains the reappearance after a disease wiped them out.
SP-28_CR,"A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible?","The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.","The mule is a known sterile animal, this cannot reproduce and therefore fits the given description. The mule is a hybrid animal, produced by breeding a male donkey (jack) with a female horse (mare) and therefore it has existed on the earth for a long history.""

SP-29,"Four men were in a boat on the lake. The boat turns over, and all four men sink to the bottom of the lake, yet not a single man got wet! Why?",Because they were all married and not single.,"The answer option ""Because they were all married and not single"" correctly resolves the ambiguity of the word ""single"" in the riddle. It implies that the marital status of the men, not their number, was the relevant aspect, leading to the conclusion that no unmarried man got wet."
SP-29_SR,"A boat on the lake included four men. All four men on the boat sink to the bottom of the lake when it flips over. However,Â notÂ aÂ single manÂ getsÂ wet! Why?",Because they were all married and not single.,This plays on the double meaning of the word 'single' and the fact that the sentence 'not a single man gets wet' implies that none of them are wet.
SP-29_CR,"A bus journeying through the desert had six women aboard. Suddenly, the bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere and all six women have to walk under the scorching sun. Yet, not a single woman gets sunburnt! Why?",Because they were all married and not single.,"The riddle suggests that all six women were exposed to the scorching sun yet didn't get sunburnt. The answer reveals that they were married, implying a connection between their marital status and not getting sunburnt. This twist catches the listener off-guard, making the answer both unexpected and humorous."
SP-31,"A horse travels a certain distance each day. Strangely enough, two of its legs travel 30 miles each day and the other two legs travel nearly 31 miles. It would seem that two of the horse's legs must be one mile ahead of the other two legs, but of course, this can't be true, since the horse is normal. How is this possible?",The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.,The horse traveling two different distances is paradoxical and the paradox is resolved by suggesting the horse moves in a circular clockwise direction.
SP-31_SR,"Every day, a horse covers a particular distance. Strangely, two of its legs cover 30 miles daily while the other two cover about 31 miles. Given that the horse is typical, it would seem that two of its legs must be a mile ahead of the other two. However, this is obviously not the case. How is that even possible?",The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. The two outside legs will travel a greater distance than the two inside legs.,The answer option provides a logical explanation that explains the phenomenon of the different distances covered by the horse's legs. It resolves the initial contradiction and presents a coherent solution.
SP-31_CR,"Each and every day, a man gets up early to work out. He always spends a few hours running about his apartments. He surprises himself by discovering that, after a month of hard training, his left leg has acquiredÂ much more muscle than his right. How is that feasible since the man is normal and healthy?",The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. The left leg traveled a greater distance than inside leg.,"The difference in muscle development is due to the specific nature of his workout routine, which involved running in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment. This led to the left leg traveling a greater distance than the right leg."
SP-32,"A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why?",The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.,This scenario is plausible and provides a logical explanation for the man's seemingly irrational behavior.
SP-32_SR,A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away.Â Why?,The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.,Because he was on a bridge and there was no safe spot to jump off initially.
SP-32_CR,"A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why?",The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.,"The only way this behavior makes sense is if the woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear, preventing her from simply stepping off the path. "
SP-34,"There were 5 men traveling down a road and it started to rain and 4 men sped up, the 5th did not, but they all arrived at the same place at the same time but all of them were wet besides the 5th. How is that possible?",He was dead and in a coffin.,"If he was dead and in a coffin, he would not have sped up when it started to rain. The other four men would have been hastening to find shelter, but the fifth man would have been immobile, explaining why he remained dry. The other four men could have sped up to get to shelter but then waited indefinitely until the fifth man's coffin arrived, explaining how they all arrived at the same place at the same time. This explains the incongruence between them all arriving at the same time and only the fifth man being dry."
SP-34_SR,"Five men were traveling down a road when it began to rain. Four of the guys sped up, but the fifth did not, but they all reached at the same location at the same time, and all but the fifth were wet. How is that even doable?",He was dead and in a coffin.,"The only way this is possible is if the fifth man is not alive and well and is, in fact, dead and in a coffin."
SP-34_CR,"Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible?",The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.,The answer option is the only one that provides a logical explanation for the scenario described in the question. Every other option would not provide a plausible answer to the riddle.
SP-35,"Three men sitting in a small motorboat one meter from the shoreline. The first is afraid of water, the second is afraid of drowning, and the third is afraid of sharks. The boat's motor is not operational and there is nothing to row with. How do they get to the shoreline?",They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.,The men can walk to the shore despite their fears because the boat is so close to the shoreline.
SP-35_SR,"A small motorboat with three men inside is parked one meter from the shore. The first fears being submerged in water, the second fears drowning, and the third fears sharks. There is nothing to row with and the boat's motor is not working. How do they reach the coast?",They can just walk onto its as the boat is one-meter inland.,"This suggests that the men's fears of submersion, drowning, and shark attacks are unfounded in this particular scenario, as the water is shallow enough for them to walk through without encountering these dangers."
SP-35_CR,"A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why?",He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.,"The man's inability to swim is countered by the shallow depth of the pool, which allows him to stand up, rendering the swimming skill unnecessary."
SP-36,"A father and son were in a car accident where the father was killed. The ambulance brought the son to the hospital. He needed immediate surgery. In the operating room, a doctor came in and looked at the little boy and said I can't operate on him he is my son. Why?",Because the doctor is the mother of the son.,the doctor is the mothers because...
SP-36_SR,"A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, ""I can't operate on him. He's my son."" after taking one look at the young patient. Why?",Because the doctor is the mother of the son.,the doctor is the mother of the son
SP-36_CR,"One the final exam day, Tom's father send him to one classroom. A teacher came over and said "" Tom can not take exam under my supervise as he is my son."" Then Tom is asked to switch to another room. Why? ",Because the teacher is the mother of the Tom.,The statement that the teacher is the mother of the Tom is the only one that fits after the riddle description.
SP-37,"A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be?",The beggar was the man's sister.,The only way to explain this riddle is the beggar had a sister and she is dead.
SP-37_SR,"The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible?",The beggar was the man's sister.,"The explanation resolves the contradiction by considering the possibility that the beggar is a woman who is the deceased's sister, making it accurate to say that the brother of a beggar passed away while the deceased had no brothers."
SP-37_CR,"The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible?",The police was the man's sister.,"The answer option resolves the paradox by revealing the police officer to be the man's sister, thus explaining the dead man's relationship and making the initial statement accurate."
SP-38,"I dig out tiny caves and store gold and silver in them. I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold. They are the smallest you could imagine. Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Why?",I am a dentist.,"The question describes metaphorical scenarios that point to the field of dentistry. The only way to explain the tiny caves and gold and silver as well as the need for help, is through the metaphor of dentistry."
SP-38_SR,"I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why?",I am a dentist.,"The question describes unusual and specific activities, which are represented as a riddle. The answer, ""I am a dentist"", aligns with the given descriptions, providing a logical solution while adhering to the riddle's format."
SP-38_CR,"I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I?",I am oxygen.,"The riddle hints at a substance that breaks down walls and corrodes steel through metaphors and figurative language. Oxygen fits these descriptions as an essential element that enables oxidation and rusting. While oxygen is crucial for survival, an uncontrolled presence through oxygen toxicity reveals the duality of its nature. Therefore, the logical path leads to the answer ""I am oxygen""."
SP-39,"How could a cowboy ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday?",His horse is named Wednesday.,"The answer resolves the paradox by suggesting that the cowboy's horse is named Wednesday, thus making it possible for the cowboy to ride in on Friday, stay for two days, and then ride out on his horse, Wednesday."
SP-39_SR,"How was it possible for a cowboy to arrive in town on Friday, stay for two days, and leave on Wednesday?",His horse is named Wednesday.,"By interpreting the phrase 'leave on Wednesday' as referring to the name of the cowboy's horse, the seemingly contradictory aspect of the question is resolved. This interpretation makes the cowboy's actions logically consistent, as he is able to arrive on one day and leave on the name of a different day."
SP-39_CR,"How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday?",The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday.,"The question is a riddle that plays with the concept of time and space. The answer option suggests a way that the pilot can take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday and land in Tokyo on Tuesday, despite the distance and time required to travel between these two cities."
SP-40,"There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive?",The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.,"The second door leads to lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. Lions require food to survive, and without food, they would die. Since 5 years have passed they would have likely died."
SP-40_SR,"Three doors are present. Every door has a way to exit. The first door has lava and fire inside. Lions behind the second door haven't eaten in five years. There is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator inside the third door. Which door will you probably get through?",The second door with the lions. Since they haven't eaten in 5 years they will have died.,Death from starvation would have inevitably occurred in five years without food.
SP-40_CR,"The king's horse was bitten by a tiger one day while hunting. The king was so furious that he punished the tiger by sending him to a cell and depriving him of food. One year later, the bishop offended the king with a joke. The king imprisoned the bishop in the same cell as a tiger for a month. But a month later, the bishop was completely unharmed and free. How is that even doable? ",Since the tiger haven't eaten in one year it will have died.,"If the tiger did not die from starvation, it would have harmed the bishop upon his entry into the cell. However, since the bishop was unharmed, the tiger must have died of starvation, culminating in the events of the riddle."
SP-41,"A plane crashed, and every single person on board this flight was killed, yet there were survivors. Explain how?",The married people lived and the singles died.,"The answer hinges on redefining the meaning of the word 'single' in this context, transforming it from referring to individuals in general to specifically referring to unmarried individuals."
SP-41_SR,"Despite the fact that the entire flight was lost in a plane crash and each single person is killed, there were survivors. Describe how?",The married people lived and the singles died.,"The answer hinges on the double meaning of the word 'single' and resolves the paradox by interpreting it as 'unmarried' or 'unattached' individuals, whereby only the married ones survived the crash."
SP-41_CR,"Tom received an invitation to a holiday party. He was shocked to discover that no single person wasÂ at the party. The party is still filled with singing, though. How is that even doable?",All people at the party except Tom is married.,"This suggests that there is a marriage ceremony at the party, and married people only."
SP-43,One lady ordered a fast delivery pizza and her order came the next year. How is this possible?,She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.,"It is possible to order a pizza just before midnight on New Year's Eve, resulting in the delivery occurring in the following year."
SP-43_SR,"One woman placed a quick delivery pizza order, and it was delivered the following year. How is that even possible?",She ordered the pizza for New Year's Day.,This highlights the importance of paying attention to specific times and dates mentioned in the riddle. The key to solving this riddle is interpreting the statement 'the following year' as referring to New Year's Day instead of a generic year.
SP-43_CR,A man bought a plane ticket to visit his hometown and landed in the next century. How did this happen?,He boarded the plane on New Year's Eve and arrived after midnight on New Year's Day of the next century.,This riddle is misleading and uses a metaphor to make you think about time travel which is not the case. The answer actually lies in the timeline of events.
SP-44,"In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible?",At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.,"The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, so water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit would be ice, and since the ball cannot fall through ice..."
SP-44_SR,A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable?,At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.,"The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, so water freezes below this temperature."
SP-44_CR,"In Jamaica, some kids can stand on the water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, how is that possible?",At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.,"At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice, and ice can support the weight of kids, enabling them to stand on it."
SP-45,Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest?,He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.,"This solution would lower the height of the truck."" 

<|/Problem|>"
SP-45_SR,"Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?",He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.,"This solution entails letting air out of the truck's tires, which will cause the truck to shorten in height and become freed from the overpass."
SP-45_CR,"Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion?",He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly.,"This solution addresses the issue of passing through the narrow part of the river, and it is consistent with the premise that Mary cannot paddle backward due to the strong current."
SP-46,"A boy had just gotten out of the shower and was getting ready for his prom, shaved and with cologne, and there would be an after-party. And his mom and dad said to be home for the next sunrise and he was home for the next sunrise but with a full-grown beard. How can this be?",He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.,This scenario is only possible if the boy lives in Alaska and utilizes the extended period of daylight to grow a full-grown beard within a short time.
SP-46_SR,"A boy had just finished getting ready for his prom, shaving, applying cologne, and there would be an after-party. His parents had told him to be home for the next sunrise, but he arrived with a full-grown beard instead. How is this possible?",He lives in Alaska and sunrise are every six months.,"The unique concept of polar nights explains the situation where the boy grows a full beard within a short timeframe, resolving the seeming contradiction."
SP-46_CR,"A man sets out to plant a flower at sunrise and his friend asks him to return by the next moonrise. But when he returns, the flower he planted has already wither and fall. How is this possible?",He lives in Alaska where a single day and night can last for months.,"This option provides a plausible explanation for the seemingly impossible timeline described in the question. The prolonged daylight hours during specific seasons in Alaska could essentially accelerate time, allowing the flower to go through its entire life cycle within a day or two, which would appear instantaneous to an outsider."
SP-48,Why is it so cold on Christmas?,Because it's in December.,"Christmas is generally in December, which is in the winter season and known for cold weather."
SP-48_SR,Why is Christmas Day so chilly?,Because it's in December.,"December is traditionally a winter month and therefore the temperatures are typically colder than other months."" 

I hope this response matches the desired format and provides you with a clear logical relation between the question and the answer. Let me know if any clarification or tailoring is needed. I'm excited to participate in more riddle scenarios."
SP-48_CR,Why is Independence Day so hot?,Because it's in July.,"July is one of the hottest months of the year due to the Earth's tilt and orbit, so the reference to this month in the riddle is likely a nod to the peak of summer heat in the Northern Hemisphere."
SP-49,"Wednesday,Tom and Joe went to a restaurant and ate dinner. When they were done they paid and left. Tom and Joe didn't pay. Who did?","Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.","The question implies that Tom and Joe, two entities, did not pay for the meal. This discrepancy is resolved by identifying Wednesday as the entity with the name different from Tom and Joe, implying it is the third person in the group, and therefore the one who paid for the meal."
SP-49_SR,"Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill?","Wednesday. The name of the third person in the group, not the day.","The answer lies in the careful reading of the question, recognizing that 'Wednesday' refers to a person with that name and not the day of the week."
SP-49_CR,"Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why?","Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total.",The only way the waiter would bring 3 sets of knives and forks is if there were 3 people at the table.
SP-50,A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water?,"The glass was filled, but not with water.","the answer option suggests that the glass was filled, but not with water, implying the magician used a substance other than water to fill the glass"
SP-50_SR,"A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling?","The glass was filled, but not with water.",The question is tricky and Misdirection play a role here. The key here is there is a distinction between an empty glass and a glass containing water. So the magician filled the glass but not with water.
SP-50_CR,"A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible?",There is no wine in the glass.,If the glass was empty there would be no wine to spill when it was knocked over.
SP-51,"Craig died in Florida. Shortly after, Tracy died at sea. Nobody mourned, In fact, everyone was absolute delighted. Why?",They were both hurricanes.,"Craig and Tracy dying at different locations is misleading, making one think of distant relatives or unrelated people. The unusual reaction to their deaths (delight) makes you think about the context of these two deaths, which leads to the conclusion that both Craig and Tracy represent something destructive, like a hurricane."
SP-51_SR,"Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic.Â Why?",They were both hurricanes.,"Realizing that the question describes the unusual situation of people reacting positively to the 'passing away' of two entities, whereas the real meaning might be hidden. i.e., the passing away of two hurricanes. The fact that the answer is a reality and fits the clues provided creates a logical connection between the question and answer."
SP-51_CR,Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why?,Morgan is the name of hurricane.,"Understanding that 'Morgan' refers to a hurricane, we realize that the story's contrasting emotions make more sense in the context of a natural disaster."
SP-52,Morgan was making apricot jam. She put all the apricots in the pot and stirred them up. Then she remembered she had to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every two apricots! How did she figure out how much lemon juice to put?,She counted the pits of apricots.,Morgan stirred the apricots and remembered she had to add lemon juice according to the ratio of 1 ounce for every two apricots. Counting the pits of the apricots would enable her to determine the total number of apricots used and thereby calculate the correct amount of lemon juice needed.
SP-52_SR,Apricot Jam was being made by Morgan. She stirred the apricots in the pot after adding them all. It was then that she realized she needed to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots! How did she calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice?,She counted the pits of apricots.,"Morgan realized that the amount of lemon juice required was two ounces of lemon juice per ounce of apricot juice. Thus, she needed to determine the number of apricots to calculate the lemon juice needed. She counted the pits of the apricots to determine the number of apricots, assuming one pit per apricot."
SP-52_CR,"Emma was making a peach cobbler. After peeling and chopping all the peaches, she realized that she had to add a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches. How did she figure out how much cinnamon to add?",She counted the peach pits.,Counting the peach pits was an ingenious approach because each peach has a pit and the number of pits equals the number of peaches.
SP-53,"A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?",She is a minister.,"A minister can marry multiple couples without marrying someone themself, the answer is related to the question through this occupation."" 

I hope this short analysis demonstrates the logical pathway to the answer using the specified hypothesis. Please let me know if you would like me to use a different approach or clarify any further points."
SP-53_SR,"A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way.Â How is that even possible?",She is a minister.,"The only way this can be possible is if the word 'wed' in the question is considered in its verb form, referring to the process of officiating a wedding ceremony. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that a woman cannot legally have a polygamous relationship and the only way to reconcile the facts presented in the question is if the woman is a minister. Therefore the conclusion provides the answer to the riddle."
SP-53_CR,"A woman living in Rome legally gave birth to five children, but she has never been pregnant. How is this possible?",The woman is a surrogate mother.,"A surrogate mother can involve a woman carrying a pregnancy for another person or people, without being genetically related to the child, hence having given birth without being pregnant herself."
SP-54,George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored?,George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.,"George walked down the stairs because he was cleaning the inside of the windows from the inside of the building, not the outside. This means he had access to the stairs so he was able to descend even if there was a power failure."
SP-54_SR,"When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on?",George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows.,"George walked down the stairs which suggests that he was indoors and able to access the building's stairs. This implication aligns with the later clarification that he was cleaning the inside of the windows, supporting the conclusion that he was indoors."
SP-54_CR,"In the midst of a plumbing shutdown, Jack was stuck on the tenth floor of an apartment building fixing a leaky pipe. The elevator was out of order due to the plumbing issue. How did he manage to get out of the building before the plumbing was fixed?","Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator.
","The answer option proposes that Jack used the stairs to leave the building. This is consistent with the information provided in the question, as there is no mention of any issues with the stairs and Jack is described as being inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator."
SP-55,"A man buys a rope from a woman for $3.00 and hands the woman a $10 bill. The woman goes into the grocery store next door to get change. She returns and gives the man $7.00. After the man leaves, the clerk from the store comes and says, ""Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me."" The woman gives the clerk a good bill. How much has the woman lost?",Seven dollars plus the rope.,"The woman loses the value of the change she gave to the man as well as the value of the rope she sold."" 

I hope this short analysis follows the logic you were looking for! Let me know if any clarification or further details would help."
SP-55_SR,"A man gives a woman a $10 bill and pays her $3 for a rope. To get change, the woman enters the grocery store right next door. When she comes back, she gives the man $7. Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me, the store clerk says as the customer leaves. The lady hands the cashier a decent bill. How much has she lost in total?",Seven dollars plus the rope.,She hands the cashier a decnt bill so it means she was aware of the counterfeit bill given to her by the man.
SP-55_CR,"A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, ""That bill you gave me was counterfeit."" The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost?",Fifteen dollars plus the perfume.,"The woman loses the money she gave as change (15$) plus the money lost from the counterfeit bill she used at the bakery (20$-15$)= 20$, the same as the value of the perfume."
SP-56,Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads?,The two camels were facing each other the entire time.,"This riddle is likely to confuse readers by the exaggerated details of head movement and the absurdity of the camels being in a desert with no reflection to create an illusion of a mirror. However, the riddle only intends to mislead with these details, and the solution is quite simple once these distractions are ignored. The question does not imply that the camels cannot move at all, only that they cannot move their heads. Therefore, the most logical first step is to assume that the two camels can see each other without moving since the question does not specify that they cannot see each other without moving their heads. This leads to the answer that the two camels were facing each other the entire time, as the hypothesis states."
SP-56_SR,"There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert. How do they manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around?",The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions.,"This answer aligns with the stated rules, as it explains that the two camels were facing each other from opposite directions, allowing them to see each other without needing to move or turn around."
SP-56_CR,"Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time?",The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses.,The ship is directly in the line of sight of both lighthouses.
SP-57,"A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this?",He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.,"This is possible because the position of the hat didn't change relative to the gun, regardless of the sharpshooter's movements or lack of vision."
SP-57_SR,"A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off?",He hung his hat on the barrel of his gun.,"The answer option suggests an unconventional setup in which the hat was placed on the gun itself, creating a situation where the shooter could accurately shoot at his hat without needing to see the target."
SP-57_CR,"A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this?","Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane. ","The answer option suggests that the pilot's action of walking 100 yards away from his plane before putting on the blindfold is not merely a random action but is part of the setup to the solution, which relies on the ring being attached to the front of his plane."
SP-58,"Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it?",He stood on a block of ice until it melted.,"The melting ice block provides the necessary height for the man to hang himself, explaining the absence of any other elevating factors mentioned by the cops."
SP-58_SR,"Two police officers entered a room without any windows and discovered a dead man who had apparently hung himself from the ceiling, though they were unable to determine how. There was no table or chair beneath him from which he could have jumped. merely a water paddle. What was his method?",He stood on a block of ice until it melted.,"The only item he could have used to stand on was the water paddle."" 

I hope these responses are satisfactory. If you would like me to refine or expand any part of the response, don't hesitate to let me know!"
SP-58_CR,"A woman is found dead in a field of snow. The only tracks are her own leading up to her. There are no signs of struggle, no other footprints, and no other evidence. Only an abandoned pack of balloons is found nearby. How did she die?",She was in a hot air balloon which was losing altitude and crashed.,"The only clue related to the mode of death is the abandoned balloon pack suggesting a connection with a hot air balloon. Consequently, it is plausible that the victim died in a hot air balloon crash."
SP-61,A truck driver went three blocks the wrong way down a one-way street without breaking the law. How come?,The truck driver was walking.,"The key to solving this riddle is realizing that the one-way street rule only applies to vehicles, not pedestrians. The truck driver was not breaking the law because he was on foot."
SP-61_SR,"Without breaking the law, a truck driver went three blocks down a one-way street. Why is that?",The truck driver was walking.,"The answer suggests that the truck driver was walking, which is consistent with the fact that pedestrians can travel in both directions on a one-way street without breaking any laws."
SP-61_CR,"Without breaking any rules, a man managed to enter a ladies-only club. How is this possible?",The man was a security guard at the club.,"The rationale behind the man's entry is based on his professional role as a security guard being exempt from the club's general admission rules. His presence is necessitated by his job responsibilities, making him an exception to the ladies-only policy."
SP-62,Nolan is outside a shop. She can not read the signs but she knows she needs to go in to make a purchase. What store is she at?,Eye glasses store.,"The inability to read the signs outside the store hints at a vision problem, and the most probable place to address this issue is indeed an eyeglasses store."
SP-62_SR,"Nolan is in front of a store. She is unable to read the signs, but she is aware that she must enter in order to make a purchase. Where in the store is she?",Eye glasses store.,"Because Nolan is unable to read the signs, she must require vision correction, which brings her to an eyeglasses store."" 

<|End of Example|>"
SP-62_CR,"Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily?",Clock store.,The building Emily is standing outside of has clocks displayed on it and she needs to enter to find out the time.
SP-63,"Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl.",None of above.,"The question is tricky, knowing that each animal has a keen sense of sight and hearing, with echolocation represented by the bat, intense vision showcased by the owl, and exceptional nocturnal eyesight exemplified by the tiger. However, the answer is none of the above, challenging the initial assumption that any of these creatures would outperform the others in total darkness. The logical relation is that we should look beyond the options presented and consider that the answer lies elsewhere."
SP-63_SR,"Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl.",None of above.,"The question is tricky, and the options are misleading. While these creatures have exceptional night vision, the key to the riddle is understanding that 'none of the above' is the correct answer. The tiger, bat, and owl are all creatures that could technically see in complete darkness, the correct answer is 'none of the above' since the question is implying there is a creature that surpasses their night vision."
SP-63_CR,"Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat?",None of above.,"This riddle is solved with the concept of 'absurd' = opposite direction. Each of the animals is known for their outstanding hearing. Without any context, if we accept that the room is soundproof, and therefore there is no way any sound can be heard, the only logical conclusion is that 'no one' hears anything."
SP-64,There was a man who everybody called Batman he knew nothing about bats and thought they were gross. He still loved it when people called him Batman! How could this be?,He was the star baseball player.,"The nickname 'Batman' is a reference to his role as a star baseball player, a connection that bypasses the typical association with the animal bat."
SP-64_SR,"Everyone called him ""Batman,"" but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible?",He was the star baseball player.,"The riddle suggests a contradiction between the protagonist disliking bats and embracing the nickname Batman. By considering the alternative meaning of 'bat' in the context of baseball, the hypothesis offers a logical connection between the nickname and the protagonist's occupation as a star baseball player, resolving the apparent contradiction."
SP-64_CR,"There is a man who everyone calls ""Lightning,"" yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as ""Lightning."" How could this be?",He's a professional sprinter.,"The nickname 'Lightning' has a different connotation in this riddle. It symbolizes speed and is associated with the profession of sprinting. This profession provides a new context for the nickname and explains his pleasure in it."" 

I hope this short explanation aligns with your requested format. Let me know if you would like me to refine it or explain any other riddles!"
SP-65,"A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, ""That little girl was my daughter."" How could that be?",The secretary was the girl's father.,"The question does not specify the gender of the secretary and simply presents the scenario. The answer assumes that the secretary could be the girl's father, which breaks the assumption that the secretary is a woman based on stereotypes. This leads to the logical solution that the secretary is the father of the girl, which answers the riddle correctly."
SP-65_SR,"A woman took her young daughter with her when she went to see her bank manager. The bank manager permitted the woman's daughter to spend the meeting with his secretary. The secretary turned to the other secretary after the woman and her daughter left and told her, ""That little girl was my daughter."" How is that possible?",The secretary was the girl's father.,The question does not specify the secretary's gender and creates a stereotype that everyone knows secretaries are women. The answer comes in breaking that stereotype and assumes the secretary is a man who is the father of the girl.
SP-65_CR,"A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, ""That boy is my son."" Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible?",The coach of the team is the boy's mother.,"The coach of the team is the boy's mother, this resolves the contradiction by questioning the assumption that the coach is necessarily male and the father is necessarily male."
SP-66,"Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How?",The poison was in the ice.,"The difference in drinking speed suggests that Juliana avoided the poison whereas Maria did not, which aligns with the answer 'The poison was in the ice."
SP-66_SR,"Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How?",The poison was in the ice.,"The difference in the speed at which Juliana and Maria consumed their drinks suggests that the poison was not in the liquid but in a solid component, specifically the ice, which had more time to release its poison for Maria than for Juliana."
SP-66_CR,"Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible?",The ice in the drinks melted and become water.,This riddle is likely referring to the phenomenon of ice cubes melting and refilling the liquid level of the drink they are in. This is a logical relation and explanation to the riddle because it is unlikely that someone would pour water into a finished drink without the drinker noticing.
SP-67,"I left my campsite and hired south for 3 miles. Then I turned east and hired for 3 miles. I then turned north and hired for 3 miles, at which time I came upon a bear inside my tent eating my food! What color was the bear?
","White.
","The only place where this scenario is possible is at the North Pole, and the only bears that live at the North Pole are white polar bears."
SP-67_SR,"I departed my campsite and traveled 3 miles to the south. I then made an eastward turn and traveled 3 miles. After 3 miles of heading north, I turned around and saw a bear eating inside my tent! The bear was what color?","White.
","The question's geographical reference indicates a location only possible at the North Pole, where polar bears reside. Polar bears are white, therefore the bear eating in the tent is white."
SP-67_CR,"A new explorer got lost while travelling. She decided to walk 3 miles to the south and made an eastward turn, and ran 3 miles. Suddenly she realized it was the wrong way then she decided to walk 3 miles to the north. Amazingly, she went back to the point of departure. Where is she?",North Pole.,This is only possible at the North Pole due to the Earth's spherical geometry.
SP-68,"How can a man who shaves several times a day still sport a long beard?
",He's a barber.,"The riddle mislead the listener to think that the man was shaving his own face, and that he would not be able to have a long beard if he shaved several times a day. However, if he is a barber, he is shaving others, and thus he can have a long beard."
SP-68_SR,How is it possible for a man to have a long beard while shaving multiple times per day?,He's a barber.,"The answer option implies that the man is shaving other people's beards, not his own. This explains how he can have a long beard despite shaving frequently.""

SP-68_CR,How can a man goes to football team every day but doesn't play football at all.,He is a coach.,"The role of a coach is often to support a sports team in succeeding without necessarily participating as a player, thereby aligning with the given information in the riddle."
SP-69,A rancher had 500 cows and took one shot that got them all. How did he do it?,A panoramic photo.,"The riddle uses wordplay by associating the phrase 'take a shot' with both violence and photography, adding an element of double meaning. The solution then provides a surprising resolution by interpreting the shot as a photographic shot, turning the narrative from a seemingly violent act into a peaceful act of photography, and resolving the paradox of the rancher's action."
SP-69_SR,A rancher shot once and killed all 500 of his cows. What was his secret?,"A panoramic photo.
",Panoramic photography is associated with capturing a wide area in a single shot.
SP-69_CR,"There are many people in the park when a woman shoots in public toward them, but no one is killed. How is that even doable?",She is a photographer.,"The answer plays on the dual meaning of the word 'shoot' (violence vs photography)"" 

I hope this short analysis demonstrates the logical path of connection between the question and the answer, adhering to the specified constraints. Please provide any additional guidance you wish me to follow or clarify any relevant aspects of this task for me to further enhance my responses."
SP-70,"A man dies of old age on his 25 birthday. How is this possible?
","He was born on February 29th
","This riddle leverages the concept of a leap year, adding an extra day to the calendar every four years. The discrepancy between the traditional birthday celebration and the actual calendar year creates the illusion that the man has lived for a quarter of a century on his 25th birthday, which aligns with the milestone of 100 years, allowing him to die of old age."
SP-70_SR,A man turns 25 and passes away from old age. How is that even possible?,"He was born on February 29th
","The man's real age was more than twice the age of his perceived age, making it plausible for him to die of old age at 25."
SP-70_CR,"John family puts a lot of emphasis on birthdays to build rapport with each other, however, this year, no one even mention John's birthday at all. Why?","He was born on February 29th
","This answer stems from the riddle's premise that John's family usually makes a big deal out of birthdays, but John's special day slipped through the cracks this year. The hypothesis clarifies that this anomaly occurred because John was born on February 29th, a date that only appears on the calendar every four years during a leap year. This means that in non-leap years, John's birthday is nonexistent, and his family's birthday-focused traditions did not apply to him this year."
SP-71,Mrs. Adams tells her neighbor that her son turns 16 today and that next birthday he'll be 20. How can that be?,"He was born on February 29.
",This riddle is a play on the uniqueness of February 29 as a birthday and the fact that calculation of age based on calendar years would be a simplification.
SP-71_SR,Mrs. Adams informs her next-door neighbor that her son is turning 16 today and will turn 20 on his next birthday. How is that possible?,"He was born on February 29.
","This riddle leverages the less common circumstance of birthdays on February 29, which only happens in leap years, adding an element of surprise. The answer unfolds by acknowledging this unique aspect and tracing the specific ages of the boy and his birthday aligned with leap years."
SP-71_CR,"He had a happy childhood and family, but he hasn't received a birthday present for three years recently. Why?","He was born on February 29.
","This scenario explains why the individual has not received a birthday present for the past three years, as their actual birth date only occurs every four years."
SP-74,"A man stands on one side of a river, his dog on the other. The man calls his dog, who immediately crosses the river without getting wet and without using a bridge or a boat. How did the dog do it?",The river was frozen.,This suggests that the river was frozen and presents a logical path for the dog to cross the river without getting wet or using external aids.
SP-74_SR,"A man and his dog are both standing on opposite sides of a river. The guy summons his dog, who quickly crosses the river without getting wet. There were no bridges or boats. What was the dog's secret?",The river was frozen.,"This suggests that the river was frozen, which would allow the dog to cross the river by walking or running on the frozen surface. This reasoning is consistent with the fact that the dog is able to cross the river without getting wet, as water in a solid state frozen river, would provide a walking surface."
SP-74_CR,"To go where he was going, the man had to cross the rivers. He was unable to utilize his inflatable raft because of a notice prohibiting boats and swimming on the bank. He finally succeeded in crossing the river. The only bridge on the river was broken. How didn't the man manage to do that?",The river was frozen.,"The answer option suggests that the river was frozen, which would allow the man to walk or slide across its surface to reach the other bank."
SP-75,"A woman is sitting in her hotel room and hears a knock at the door. She opens the door to see a man whom she's never met before. He says, ""I'm sorry, I have made a mistake, I thought this was my room."" He then goes down the corridor and into the elevator. The woman goes back into her room and calls security. What made the woman so suspicious of the man?
","If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.
",She realizes that if he thought it was his room he would have tried to open the door not knock on it.
SP-75_SR,"A knock on the door is heard by the woman while she is seated in her hotel room. When she opens the door, she is greeted by a stranger. I'm sorry, I made a mistake; I thought this was my room, he apologizes. He then exits the elevator and walks down the hall. The woman returns to her room and makes a security call. What gave the woman cause to be so wary of the man?","If he really thought it was his hotel room, he would have tried to open the door not knock on it first.
","The man's actions contradicted his words, which suggested a possible deception."
SP-75_CR,"A sudden rustling noise startles the hiker as he explores a remote forest. He turns around to see a man emerging from the bushes. ""Oops, wrong trail,"" the man says with a sheepish smile. He then retraces his steps and disappears into the wilderness. The hiker, feeling uneasy, decides to take precautionary measures. What made the hiker suspicious of the man?","If he had genuinely taken the wrong trail, he would have been more likely to ask for directions or consult a map.","The man's behavior is incongruent with what a genuine lost hiker would do, and his odd actions trigger the hiker's suspicion."
SP-76,"In a one-story house at the corner of the road, the bedrooms were yellow, the kitchen was orange, the living room was red, the garage was blue, the entry hall was green and the sitting room was purple. What color were the stairs?
",None of above.,"The house is one story, so there is no stair case since stairs are for ascending/descending levels hence the option 'None of the above' is true."
SP-76_SR,"A one-story home at the intersection of the street had bedrooms painted yellow, a kitchen painted orange, a living room painted red, a garage painted blue, an entryway painted green, and a sitting room painted purple. Which color did the stairs have?",None of above.,"The property is described as a one-story home, but the rooms are divided as if it had multiple stories, with a room on each floor painted a different color. However, the question states that there is no stairway in the house, meaning it is a one-story home and thus has no stairs."
SP-76_CR,"In a lively art gallery, a diverse collection of paintings adorns the walls. The abstract artworks are hung on white frames, the landscape paintings are framed in rustic wood, the portraits are showcased in elegant gold frames, the modern art pieces are displayed in sleek black frames, and the still-life paintings are presented in ornate silver frames. How are the white sculptures exhibited?",None of above.,"The question describes the frames of each painting with specificity, listing abstract, landscape, portrait, modern, and still-life paintings and their corresponding frame colours. This list, however, does not include a category for white frames. Thus, the logical conclusion is that the white sculptures are not framed, or the white frames option is not correct."
SP-77,"Sally lives in a place where six months of the year is mild summer and the temperature drops significantly the other six months. She owns a lake where there is a small island. She wants to build a house on the island and needs to get materials there. She doesn't have a boat, plane, or anything to transport them to the island. How does Sally solve this problem?
","She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.",This option takes into account the given information about the lake freezing during the colder months as well as Sally's need to transport materials without any typical water-based or aerial transportation methods. It creates a logical connection between the provided information and the answer.
SP-77_SR,"Sally lives in an area with a warm summer for six months of the year and a harsh winter for the other six. She has a lake with a tiny island in it. She needs to transport supplies to the island since she wants to build a house there. She lacks a boat, an aircraft, or any other means of transportation to get them to the island. How does Sally deal with this issue?","She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.
",This suggests that Sally is aware that the lake freezes over in the winter months and that the ice will support her weight. This allows her to walk onto the lake and transport supplies to the island without recourse to any form of mechanical transport.
SP-77_CR,"James lives in a remote mountainous region that experiences heavy snowfall during the winter season. He wants to set up a cozy cabin on a picturesque plateau, but he needs to transport construction materials and furniture to the location. Unfortunately, there are no roads or accessible paths to reach the plateau. How does James overcome this challenge?",He waits for the heavy snowfall during the winter months and uses a sled to transport the construction materials and furniture.,James is creative in his approach and thinks out of the box. He recognizes that the heavy snowfall can be used to his benefit by creating a path for transportation of materials. This allows him to negate the need for traditional roads or paths and demonstrates his ability to adapt and innovate.
SP-80,"What word would you use to describe a man who does not have all his fingers on one hand?
",None of above.,"The correct response 'None of the above' is not explicitly giving a description of the man, but rather negating the options provided. This is based on the reasoning that having fewer than 10 fingers is relatively common, and not a specific disability, so the man is not 'digitally impaired,' which is too strong of a phrase given the context. The man also does have all his fingers on one hand, so he is not 'disabled' either. While 'digitally handicapped' could be a correct analogy, the phrase is not used commonly and may be intended as a red herring."
SP-80_SR,What adjective best describes a man without all of his fingers on one hand?,None of above.,"The question is tricky because it prompts you to consider options that are not technically correct, which is why 'none of the above' is the best answer. The word 'digitally' is introducing the concept of fingers in terms of numbers, as in 'digital numbers', so in this context, 'digitally impaired' would mean someone who doesn't have all their numeric digits, which is to say, all of their fingers."
SP-80_CR,What adjective best describes a man without all of his toes on one foot?,None of above.,"The question is asking for an adjective that describes a man without all of his toes on one foot. The provided options are related to digital disability or impairment, which is not the same as losing bodily toes."
SP-81,"How did the boy kick his soccer ball ten feet, and then have it come back to him on its own?
","He kicked it up.
","Kicking the ball upwards explains how the boy could kick the ball ten feet away and have it come back to him on its own. The ball would ascend, reach its peak, and then descend back to the boy, resulting in its return."
SP-81_SR,"How did the young youngster kick his soccer ball 10 feet, and it miraculously returned to him?","He kicked it up.
","The young man kicked the ball in such a way that it went upwards, not forwards"
SP-81_CR,"A star baseball pitcher threw the baseball 1 mile far, and it miraculously returned to him? How is that possible.","He threw it up.
","The only way this is possible is if the baseball was thrown upwards, against gravity, and not horizontally, parallel to the ground."
SP-82,"Two mothers and two daughters went out to eat, everyone ate one slice of pizza, yet only three slices were eaten. How's that possible?
","The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.",The key to solving this riddle is understanding the double role of the grandmother as both a mother and a daughter. This unique relationship allows for the unusual scenario of two mothers and two daughters while still accounting for the fact that only three slices of pizza were eaten.
SP-82_SR,"When two moms and two daughters went out to dine, just three slices of pizza were consumed. What makes that possible?","The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.
","The answer option provides a logical explanation that complies with the rules of the riddle, thereby giving a definite answer."
SP-82_CR,Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They equally split the $21 they have between them. How on earth is this even possible?,"The group included a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter's daughter.
","The key to solving this riddle is understanding the concept of generations and how relationships can be interpreted in a flexible manner. The hypothesis highlights that the group comprised a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter, which is indeed a clever way to navigate the seemingly contradictory information provided in the question."
SP-83,"A man dressed in all black is walking down a country lane. Suddenly, a large black car with no lights on comes around the corner and speeches to a halt. How did the car's driver know he was there?","It was day time.
","The description of the man wearing all black and the black car with no lights suggests an intentional emphasis on the absence of light-related cues. This misdirection focuses attention on the need for light to see, but the key insight is that the incident takes place during the day, providing sufficient ambient light to spot the man. Thus, the logical connection is established: the daytime provides the necessary light to see, negating the need for artificial lights or reliance on clothing colors."
SP-83_SR,"A guy is strolling down a rural way while wearing nothing but black. Unexpectedly, a big, dark automobile turns the corner without any lights on and stops abruptly. How did the driver of the automobile know that he was there?","It was day time.
","The man's clothing was black, and the automobile did not have its lights on. The only way the driver of the automobile knew that he was there is if there was enough light to see him, resulting in the conclusion that it must be daytime."
SP-83_CR,"A girl was hanging around in the countryside. She slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible?",The well is dry.,"A 60-foot well, by definition, is a deep structure drilled into the ground with the purpose of extracting water. However, the question states that the girl fell into the well and did not get wet. This contradictory information prompts us to seek an alternative explanation, leading us to consider the well being dry as a valid answer."
SP-84,Why are 1968 pennies worth more than 1967 pennies?,"Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies
","This joke relies on the double meaning behind the numerical representation of the year and the numerical value of individual pennies. Taking the misinterpretation one step further, the hypothesis explains how this discrepancy results in the 1968 pennies supposedly being worth more."" 

This riddle relies on a double meaning. At first glance, it seems like a numerical puzzle, but the answer has nothing to do with math. Instead, it's a play on words, a metaphorical association, and irony."
SP-84_SR,Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?,"Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies
",The question is not about dates but about numbers of pennies. Each year an additional penny was added to the coins. This continues until today. This growing number of pennies explains the higher value of 1968 pennies in comparison to the 1967 pennies.
SP-84_CR,Why is the value of 1990 dollars higher than 1989 dollars ?,"Because there is one more dollars.
","The question is misleadingly worded, making it seem like a puzzle when the answer is quite simple. The only logical connection is that 1990 is simply a year after 1989, and hence it is obvious that there would be one more dollar in 1990 than 1989, simply because every subsequent year has an increment of one more dollar."

After fifteen minutes of riding, the bus stops, Raymond gets off, and a guy and his wife board. A woman then boards the bus while carrying a caged bird. Who is the bus driver?
",None of above.,"The question asks who is the bus driver. Each answer choice refers to a person on the bus but does not include the bus driver themselves. Therefore, the answer is 'none of the above."
SP-85_CR,"You held an NLP conference and invited many professors. Prof Jessica and Prof Zeng started with Large Language Models. Prof Tom followed up with some insights into Transformer. Prof Tang switched to discuss Big Data, and Prof James provided recent work on Knowledge Graphs. Prof Raymond summarized the conference at the end. Who held this conference?",None of above.,"All the mentioned professors (Jessica, Zeng, Tom, Tang, and James), assisted in discussing various topics during the conference, except for Prof. Raymond, who summarized the conference at the end. Thus, Prof. Raymond was the organizer."
SP-86,"How much dirt is there in a hole that is 3 feet deep, 6 feet long, and 4 feet wide?
",None of above.,"This riddle is solved by acknowledging that dirt is not measured in feet. Thus, one finds that the amount of dirt is not represented in the options provided."
SP-86_SR,"In a hole that is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, how much dirt is there?",None of above.,"The hole is described as being 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. These measurements describe the dimensions of the hole in three dimensions (length, width, depth). Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the amount of dirt in cubic feet. The dirt is assumed to be in the shape of a rectangular prism. The amount of dirt would be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the hole. Each dimension is given as its shortest side, so the calculation would be 4 x 3 x 6, resulting in 72 cubic feet of dirt."
SP-86_CR,"In a tube that is 6 feet long with 3 feet in radius, how much water can it store?",None of above.,"If we calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula, it would be v = Ï * r^2 * h, where v is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. Plugging in the given values, we have v = Ï * 3^2 * 6 = 108Ï cubic feet. This is the exact answer, not one of the options provided, thus the 'none of the above' option is correct."
SP-87,How can you lift an elephant with one hand?,None of above.,"This is a playful riddle with the answer being 'none of the above.' The question intends to trick you by suggesting the unrealistic scenario of lifting an elephant with a single hand, making you believe that you need extraordinary tools like a crane, forklift, or hydraulic jacks. However, the correct solution negates the options provided, implying that none of these mechanisms are necessary, and, in fact, you cannot lift an elephant with one hand, no matter how strong it is."
SP-87_SR,How to carry an elephant on one hand?,None of above.,"The riddle explicitly states 'on one hand', indicating that it is a bold claim that cannot be achieved with any of the tools listed, each of which requires at least two hands to operate."
SP-87_CR,How to fit an entire mountain inside a suitcase?,None of above.,"The answer states 'none of the above'. This suggests that the mountain cannot be fitted inside a suitcase through the methods listed: dissolving it, breaking it apart, or melting it. Each of these options is a possible way to make a mountain more compact, meaning that logic leads you to the conclusion that none of these options apply to the puzzle."
SP-88,"Name the most recent year in which New Year's came before Christmas.
","This year. 
",This riddle plays with the ordinary perception of chronological order and makes you consider the year as a cycle.
SP-88_SR,What was the most recent year when New Year's arrive before Christmas?,"This year. 
","The question is a trick one, playing with the order of events in a year. The most recent year when New Year's arrives before Christmas is always the current year."
SP-88_CR,Which year in the history that New Year's arrive before Christmas?,"Every year.
","This plays on the repetitive nature of calendars and the order of the two holidays in the conventional sense, but the riddle's assertion holds true every 365 days."
SP-89,"If the vice president were to die, who is supposed to be president?",The President.,"The 25th Amendment states that the President remains in office if the Vice President dies, and the President would then nominate a new Vice President."
SP-89_SR,Who would take office as president if the vice president passed away?,The President.,"The very nature of the question suggests a continuation of power, as the presidency doesn't change hands based on the vice president's status. Hence, the correct answer is the president themself, who would continue to lead regardless of the vice president's circumstances."
SP-89_CR,"If the vise captain of a ship were to step down, who is supposed to take command?",The captain.,"The chain of command on the ship dictates that the captain is of the highest authority and therefore retains command, even when the vice captain steps down."
SP-91,"Some months have eight letters in their name, whereas others have five. How many have three?
",They all do.,"The abbreviations for all months are three letters long, therefore the answer is \""They all do.\"
SP-91_SR,"Some months' names contain eight letters, while others only contain five. Which month has three?",They all do.,"The question is asking for a month that contains three letters in its name. The answer 'They all do' refers to the word 'month' itself. This answer relates back to the original riddle, stating that some months have eight letters in their name and others only five. The common factor is that all months, just like the word 'month', contain five letters."
SP-91_CR,"Some seasons'name contain four letters, while others contains six. Which season contains three letters.",None of above.,"The question states that some seasons are represented by four letters (spring, winter, fall) while others are represented by six (summer, autumn). This leads you to think that the third option, with three letters, would be the correct answer. But this is exactly what the riddle is leading you away from, making the answer 'None of the above' the logical solution."
SP-92,"Sandy claims she saw an ocean without water, and it turns out, she was being honest. How is that possible?
",The ocean is on a map.,"This riddle leverages the double meaning of the phrase 'seeing an ocean.' It plays on the understanding that physically, an ocean is composed of water and then challenges this notion by suggesting that an ocean can exist without water. Upon reflection, however, the riddle offers a logical resolution by referencing a map, which metaphorically 'shows' an ocean without the necessity of water."
SP-92_SR,"It turns out that Sandy was being truthful when she said she had seen an ocean devoid of water. How is it even doable?
",Sandy saw the ocean on a map.,"This question intentionally creates a paradox to confuse respondents. If Sandy claims to have seen an ocean without water, it implies an impossible situation. The answer resolves this paradox by suggesting Sandy made her statement referring to a map, which is a realistic and common practice."
SP-92_CR,"It turns out that Sandy was being truthful when she said she had seen an forest devoid of leaves. How is it even doable?
",Sandy saw the forest on a map.,"Sandy's statement that she saw a forest devoid of leaves conflicts with the seemingly impossible nature of such an event. The introduction of the map detail resolves this discrepancy by providing an alternate, plausible scenario. Thus, the logical relation lies in the introduction of this contextual element allowing the two seemingly contradictory concepts to coexist."
SP-93,"While a cat was outside, it started to downpour. The cat couldnât find any shelter and got completely soaked by the rain, yet not a single hair was wet. How could this be?",It was a hairless cat.,"The question presents a paradoxical situation which the answer option resolves by suggesting that the cat was hairless, explaining why not a single hair got wet even though the cat got completely soaked."
SP-93_SR,"A cat was outside when it began to rain. Even though the cat was thoroughly saturated by the rain and had nowhere to hide from it, not a single hair was wet. How is this possible?",It was a hairless cat.,The absence of hair on the cat solves the contradiction presented in the question.
SP-93_CR,"A person was outside when it started snowing heavily. Even though he was directly exposed to the snowfall without any protection, not a single snowflake landed on his hair. How is this possible?",He is bold.,"This option provides a logical explanation for the scenario presented in the question. It addresses the key detail of the person not getting wet despite being exposed to heavy snowfall, which aligns with the premise of the riddle. The association between being bald and not having snow on one's hair is a clever twist that challenges conventional thinking, making it a compelling answer."
SP-94,"Two men had to go to the south side of the river, the river is pretty wide and rapid. There is one boat, but only one person fits on it. Lucky they both got to the south side of the river. How? ",One person already at the south side of the river.,"One person already at the south side of the river."" The answer to the riddle is implicit in the hypothesis itself."
SP-94_SR,"There is only one boat, yet only one person can fit on it. The river is pretty wide and rapid. Fortunately, they both get to south side of the river. How? ",One person already at the south side of the river.,"Only one person needs to go to the other side of the river by boat, as the other one is already there."
SP-94_CR,"Two person had to go to the top of the hill. There's only one motorcycle, yet only one person can ride it. Fortunately, they both get to the top of the hill. How?",One person is already at the top of the hill.,"One person is already at the top of the hill, so only one person needed to ride the motorcycle and both of them reached the top of the hill."" 

I hope this response matches the desired short format and that you find it to be insightful! If you'd like me to parse any additional riddles or refine my explanations, don't hesitate to ask."
SP-95,A girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and parties for 3 days and came back on the 4th of July. How did she do that?,She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.,"This answer resolves the contradiction by explaining the girl's return date was not actually the 4th of July, but rather she returned on a boat named ""July 4th"". This metaphor connects the literal 4th of July to the boat, resolving the paradox while maintaining the spirit of the riddle."
SP-95_SR,"On July 4, a girl traveled to the United States to party for three days before returning on July 4. How did she manage that?",She went over on the date of the 4th of July and came home on the boat called the July 4.,"This answer relies on a play on words, where the girl's return journey is represented by the boat called July 4th, rather than the actual date. This allows her to travel to the United States on July 4th, enjoy a three-day celebration, and then return on the boat named July 4th, resolving the paradox presented in the question."
SP-95_CR,"On May 1, a boy flew to Japan to participate in a festival for five days before returning on May 1. How did he manage that?",He went over on the date of the 1st of May and came home on the airplane named the May 1.,This answer works resolves the contradiction by explaining a clever play on words.
SP-96,There are 8 brothers. Brother 1 is playing checkers. Brother 2 is eating. Brother 3 is watching video games. Brother 4 is dancing. Brother 5 is texting. Brother 6 is at school. Brother 7 is sleeping. What is Brother 8 doing?,Brother 8 is playing checkers.,"The only mention of checkers in the riddle is when Brother 1 is playing them. The activities of each brother is listed without any overlap, and the only instance of checkers referenced is when Brother 1 is playing it."
SP-96_SR,8 brothers are present. Chess is being played by Brother 1. Brother 2 is chowing down. The third brother is playing video games. 4th Brother is jiving. Brother 5 is sending an SMS. Brother No. 6 is in class. Brother 7 is sound asleep. Who or what is Brother 8?,Brother 8 is playing checkers.,"The only reference to chess in the entire riddle is brother 1 playing chess, and chess and checkers are both referred to as 'chess'."
SP-96_CR,There are 5 friends. Friend 1 is palying hide and seek. Friend 2 is playing guitar. Friend 3 is reading a book. Friend 4 is swimming. What is Friend 5 doing?,Friend 5 is palying hide and seek.,"The question does not provide enough information regarding Friend 5's action. The answer assumes that Friend 5 is playing hide and seek, just like Friend 1, based on the activity of a group sport that usually requires more than one player."
SP-97,"There lived a man in a house and every time he went to bed he turned on the light. One night, the man forgot to turn on the light. The next day he read the paper and sinking into deep self-blame. Why? ",The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.,"This suggests that the man's seemingly odd habit of turning on the light every night has a practical purpose, explaining the reason behind his actions. This also highlights the importance of attention to detail, as overlooking small clues can lead to incorrect interpretations."
SP-97_SR,"In a home where he resided, the man always lit the room before bed. The man neglected to switch on the light one evening. He read the newspaper the following day and sinking into deep self-blame. Why? ",The man lived in a lighthouse. He forgot to turn on the light and a ship crashed.,"This explains the man's guilt for not performing his duty, which led to an unfortunate incident."
SP-97_CR,"A man went to sleep with the light on. However, his boss didn't blame for wasting electricity him after seeing that. Why?",The man lived in a lighthouse.,"The answer option specifies that the man lives in a lighthouse, which is relevant to the situation described in the question. Lighthouses emit light as part of their functional purpose, thereby mitigating any concern about wasting electricity."
SP-98,"David's birthday is in December, but it is never in the winter. Why? ",He lives in Australia.,David's birthday is in December but it is never in winter. The riddle suggests that David's birthday is in winter but since he lives in Australia the seasons are reversed therefore placing David's birthday in the summer.
SP-98_SR,"Despite being in December, David's birthday is never in the winter. Why? ",He lives in Australia.,"David's birthday being in December but not in winter is explained by his residence in Australia, a country in the Southern Hemisphere where the seasons are reversed."
SP-98_CR,"Despite being in June, David's birthday is never in the summer. Why? ",He lives in Australia.,"This riddle relies on an ironic twist based on geographical associations. The resolution lies in understanding the opposite seasonal dynamics between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, thereby turning the seasonal expectation underpinning the puzzle on its head."
SP-99,"Two teams were playing soccer against each other. One player from Team One scored a hat trick (triple goal). Their teammates were very happy. But when he scored the fourth goal, their teammates scolded him instead. How could this be possible?",The player scored in their own goal.,The only way his teammates could have reacted negatively is if the fourth goal was an own goal.
SP-99_SR,"Soccer was being played between two teams. Team One had a player score a hat trick (triple goal). Their comrades rejoiced greatly. However, after he scored the fourth goal, his teammates reprimanded him. How is this even conceivable?",The player scored in their own goal.,"The player's scoring a fourth goal resulted in a disadvantage for his team, thus, likely prompting reprimanding from his teammates."" 

I hope these responses are satisfactory for this task! Let me know if anything needs adjusting or if you would like to proceed to another prompt."
SP-99_CR,"Soccer was being played between two teams. Team One had a player who score two balls in a role. Team TWO doesn't have a player scoring due to the good defense of Team One. However, Team One still loss the game. Why?",The player scored in their own goal.,"It is unlikely that a player cannot score despite the 'good defense' of the opposing team. Thus, the only way this scenario could happen is if the scoring player of Team One accidentally scored in the opponent's goal."
SP-100,"Two girls have the same parents and were born at the same hour of the same day of the same month, but they are not twins. How can this be possible?",They were not born in the same year.,"This option resolves the contradiction presented in the question. By suggesting that the two girls were born in different years, it explains why they are not twins while still upholding the information provided about their synchronized birthtimes."
SP-100_SR,"The same parents gave birth to two girls at the same time on the same day in the same month, but they are not twins. Why is this even a possibility?",They were not born in the same year.,"The answer option provides a way to differentiate the two girls born on the same date and time, and not twins, by suggesting they were born in different years. This resolves the contradiction posed initially, as twins are defined by their simultaneous birth."
SP-100_CR,"The same restaurant was in two friends calendars for the same hour, day, and month. They did not, however, cross paths. How is that even doable?",They ddin't go in the same year.,The only way this could happen is if the appointments were in different years.
SP-101,"A man is walking along the sea beach. To his surprise, he can clearly see his own footstep without turning back. How is that possible?",He is walking backward.,"This option provides a logical explanation for the man's ability to see his own footprints without turning back. It explains that the man is moving in a reverse direction to his orientation, leaving behind footprints that he can observe easily."
SP-101_SR,"Walking along the seashore is a man. Without turning around, he is surprised to see his own footstep clearly. How is that even doable?",He is walking backward.,"He is walking backward explains the man's ability to see his own footprint without turning around, as he is moving in the opposite direction and can see the prints he left behind."
SP-101_CR,"Strolling in a snow-covered field, a woman is amazed to see her own snow angel clearly. She hasn't turned around. How is this possible?",She was moving backwards while making the snow angel.,This option directly references the actions described in the riddle.

SP-102,"Three people are stuck inside a dark cave. The first fears the complete darkness, the second fears bats, and the third fears getting lost. They don't have any flashlights, lanterns or any kind of light source, and their cell phones have no signal so they can't use them as a light source either. How do they get out of the cave?",They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.,The available options eliminate the fears of the three people; they just walk out of the cave as the light eliminates the problem.
SP-102_SR,"In a pitch-black cave, three individuals are imprisoned. The first is terrified of total darkness, the second is terrified of bats, and the third is terrified of becoming lost. They lack any form of light source, including flashlights, lanterns, and mobile phones, which they cannot use as a light source since they have no signal. How are they going to escape the cave?",They can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave.,"The individuals' fears are not addressed in the solution. Instead, the focus is on the external conditions, specifically the time of day and the availability of natural light. Since the question does not mention any obstacles at the cave's exit, the key lies in harnessing external sources of light to aid their escape."
SP-102_CR,"A black dog stands in the middle of an intersection in a town that has been painted black. None of the street lights are working due to a storm-related power loss. When a car approaching the dog with two damaged headlights, it moves aside in time to miss him. How was the motorist able to spot the dog in time?","It was day time.
","This suggests that the event took place during the day, allowing the motorist to see the dog due to the illumination from the sun despite the other challenges."
SP-103,"A woman living in London, has four sons. All of them are doctors, but none of them ever attended medical school. How is this possible?","The woman's sons are all ""doctors"" in the academic sense ","The title 'doctor' has a dual meaning, with the answer highlighting the academic qualification."
SP-103_SR,"A mom with four boys resides in London. Despite the fact that they are all doctors, none of them ever attended medical school. How is it even possible?","The woman's sons are all ""doctors"" in the academic sense ","The title 'doctor' has a dual meaning, connoting both medical professionalism and highest academic degree."
SP-103_CR,"Johnson is a famous doctors in the world and benefit mankind greatly. However, he never been to a medical school. How is that possible?","Johnson is a ""doctors"" in the academic sense ",The answer resolves the paradox by suggesting a different interpretation of the word 'doctor'.
SP-104,"A girl slipped and fell into a 60-foot well, yet she didn't get wet. How is this possible?",The well is dry.,This suggests that the girl did not get wet upon falling into the well because there was no water to make her wet in the first place.
SP-104_SR,"A girl fell into a 60-foot well after slipping, but she was unwet. How is it even possible?",The well is dry.,"This suggests that the well is dry, and therefore the girl did not get wet."
SP-104_CR,"A boy accidentally walked into a 10-foot deep pool, yet he didn't get wet. How is this possible?",The pool was empty.,"This suggests that the pool was empty, contrary to the expectation that a pool is filled with water."
SP-105,"I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible?","The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.","The answer explains that the 'stone' was not an ordinary stone but a seed, specifically the seed of a cherry that is known as a 'stone'."
SP-105_SR,"I planted a stone, and it sprouted leaves and fruit. How is that even possible?","The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.","The riddle uses metaphorical language to describe a planted stone that grows leaves and fruit. The hypothesis offers a literal interpretation of the metaphor, stating that the 'stone' was actually a seed, specifically the stone of a cherry, which explains the growth described in the metaphor."
SP-105_CR,"Two farmers got into a heated argument and started fighting. A farmer was so enraged that he threw a handful of stones at the other farmer. The stones hit the farmer exactly, but the other farmer received no harm at all.  Why?","The stones was actually seeds, not ordinary stones. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.","The question refers to a heated argument between two farmers and a situation where a farmer throws a handful of stones at the other. The answer suggests that the stones were actually seeds, which aligns with the fact that the stone of a cherry (a fruit) is called a stone, and seeds are not typically associated with harm. This introduces the concept of botanical terminology and the dual meaning of the word 'stone,' providing a logical connection to the answer."
SP-106,An electric train is going south at 98 mph. The wind is blowing northeast. Which direction is the smoke blowing?,None of above.,"This is a tricky one! The train is going south, but the wind is blowing northeast. So, if the smoke is blowing in the direction of the wind, it would be going northeast. However, if you consider the motion of the train, then the smoke is going southwards. But since the question states that the train is electric and does not produce smoke, therefore there is no smoke. So, the most logical answer is 'None of the above'""."
SP-106_SR,"At 98 mph, an electric train is traveling south. There is a northeast wind. Where is the smoke coming from?",None of above.,"Because the train is electric, there is no smoke. So, the option 'None of the above.' is the correct answer, but in a tricky way."
SP-106_CR,A submarine is moving west at a speed of 30 knots. There is a strong current moving east. Where are the trail of bubbles coming from?,None of above.,"The bubbles can't move in the opposite direction of the submarine, therefore the answer is none of the above."
SP-107,"There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?",It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.,"The correct answer is supported by the fact that male chickens, unlike female chickens, are not able to lay eggs, thereby rendering the entire scenario described in the riddle impossible."
SP-107_SR,"There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?",It didn't because rosters don't lay eggs.,"This hinges on the biological fact that roosters, being male chickens, do not lay eggs. Therefore the rooster in question must not have laid an egg on the barn roof."
SP-107_CR,"A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?",Because roosters don't lay eggs.,"Understanding that roosters are male chickens and, therefore, do not lay eggs, resolves the contradiction of the farmer's efforts not yielding any eggs."
SP-108,"There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs?",There are no stairs in a single story house.,"This is a trick question and the answer lies in the definition of a single story house."" 

These riddles employ a variety of tricks and it is fun to understand how they lead to an answer. 

Let me know if this helps and whether you would like me to explain the logic of another riddle."
SP-108_SR,"The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors?",There are no stairs in a single story house.,"The absence of a second floor negates the need for stairs, aligning with the absence of any stair-related color description in the given question."

What color is the basement?",There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.,"A one-story house is built on a single level, eliminating the possibility of a basement below it."
SP-109,"Two fathers and two sons went fishing one day. They were there the whole day and only caught 3 fish. One father said, that is enough for all of us, we will have one each. How can this be possible?","There was the father, his son, and his son's son.","The riddle is a trick question that challenges our initial understanding of family relationships. It invites you to consider a deeper interpretation of the phrase 'two fathers and two sons,' which can be interpreted as three generations of family members. By recognizing this, you can solve the riddle by concluding that there were only three people, thus making it possible for each to have one fish."
SP-109_SR,"One day, two dads and two sons went fishing. They were there all day and barely caught three fish. One father stated, ""That is enough for all of us; we will each have one."" How is this possible?","There was the father, his son, and his son's son.","The twist lies in the relationship between the individuals involved. Each of them plays multiple roles, with the father being a son to his grandson and the son being a father to his son, thereby establishing an unusual connection."
SP-109_CR,"There were two bosses and two employees in a meeting room discussing different tasks. At the end of the meeting, there three tasks for all the people in that meeting. How is that possible","There was one boss with his employee, and that employee was somebody else's boss.","It offers a thoughtful explanation, taking into account the given information and providing a logical pathway to the answer. This scenario presents a riddle that unfolds through the concept of hierarchical leadership, where one employee reports to a boss, who himself reports to another boss. By embracing this layered dynamic, the group is able to distribute three distinct tasks, one assigned to each of the two bosses and one assigned to the shared employee-boss."" 

This way, the thought pathway is structured along the logic of a organisational hierarchy and the distribution of tasks in a workplace."
SP-110,"A bus driver was heading down a street in Colorado. He went right past a stop sign without stopping, he turned left where there was a ""no left turn"" sign, and he went the wrong way on a one-way street. Then he went on the left side of the road past a cop car. Still - he didn't break any traffic laws. Why not?",He was walking.,"The key to solving this riddle is recognizing that the bus driver's actions described in the question are only traffic violations when committed by a vehicle. The answer highlights the contrast between being a pedestrian and a driver and eventually leads to the conclusion that since the bus driver was walking, he didn't break any traffic laws."
SP-110_SR,"A bus driver was driving along a Colorado roadway. He drove straight through a stop sign, turned left when there was a ""no left turn"" sign, and traveled the opposite way on a one-way street. He then drove on the left side of the road, passing a police cruiser. Nonetheless, he did not violate any traffic laws. So why not?",He was walking.,"The answer acknowledges that the actions described in the question would typically be illegal, but clarifies that they only apply to drivers operating a vehicle."
SP-110_CR,"A thief was walking down the street. He walked past the security guards and also the people whom he had stolen from. Nevertheless, nobody was catching him. So why not?","At that time, he was just walking down the street.

He returned the parrot but the shopkeeper said he never lied about the parrot. How can this be?",The parrot was deaf.,"If the parrot was deaf, it could not hear anything that Davey was saying to it and therefore could not repeat it."
SP-111_SR,"A pet store owner had a parrot with the sign ""Parrot repeats everything it hears"" on its cage. Davey bought the parrot and chatted to it for two weeks without it saying anything. He returned the parrot, but the shopkeeper said he had never lied about it. How is this possible?",The parrot was deaf.,"If the parrot was deaf, it could not hear anything Davey was saying, hence it could not repeat anything."
SP-111_CR,"There was an employee that told on his resume that he will do anything that he will be told be to. Nonetheless, on the first day of job in the manufacturing company, his boss was really annoyed as he wasn't doing anything his boss was showing him to do. What was the problem ?

The boss needs to change the way he communicates.
SP-112,How can you leave a room with two legs and return with six legs?,Bring a chair back with you.,"By interpreting 'legs' as 'the supporting posts of a chair'"", you can interpret the answer as ""Bring a chair back with you""."
SP-112_SR,How can you leave a room with two legs and return with six legs?,Bring a chair back with you.,"The riddle prompts you to realize that legs can also refer to the legs of a chair, which adds another layer to the meaning of the word. This enables the solution, as carrying a chair grants the bearer six 'legs' in total: their two human ones and the chair's four."
SP-112_CR,How can you leave your office with two legs and come back with a dog but still two legs,You're carrying the dog yourself.,It is important to pay attention to the entirety of the riddle and not just focus on the misleading half of it. The second part of the riddle clears up any misunderstandings and provides the actual meaning.
SP-113,"Some months have 30 days, some months have 31 days. How many have 28?",They all do,"The riddle is misleadingly stating that some months have 28 days, some 30, and some 31, which would lead you to believe that February is the only month with 28 days. However, the correct interpretation is that February, with its varying number of days depending on the leap year, and the other months are all referenced in the riddle, thus 'they all do' have at least 28 days."
SP-113_SR,"Some months have 30 days, while others have 31. How many people have 28?",They all do.,"This question is a play on words, initially confusing the reader by mentioning months with 30 and 31 days, then shifting to months with 28 days."
SP-113_CR,"Some animals have four legs and some only have two, Which one of them have one leg?",They all do.,The answer options imply that all animals are inherently unified by the fact that they all have one leg.
SP-114,"Two students attend the same school, have the same teacher, and were born on the same day of the same month, but they are not siblings. How can this be possible?",They were not born in the same year.,"The students were not born in the same year, which is a logical explanation consistent with the riddle's narrative. This distinction makes them unrelated individuals sharing coincidental attributes other than their parents being their parents."
SP-114_SR,"Although they wereÂ born on the same day of the same month, two students who go to the same school and share a teacher are not related. How is this even conceivable?",They were not born in the same year.,"This highlights the importance of paying attention to every detail in the question, even seemingly trivial information. In this case, the crucial detail is omitted, which is the birth year of the students. This gap in information allows for the plausible explanation that the students are not related."
SP-114_CR,"Two men were working in the same store with the same shift and same tasks given to them, however they were not seeing each other at all. How can this be possible?",They were living in different periods of time and both working in that store.,"This highlights the idea that time is a critical dimension that can explain seemingly contradictory situations, emphasizing the unconventional thinking required for riddle-solving."
SP-115,A man was just doing his job when his suit was torn. Why did he die three minutes later?,"He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.",The tearing of the suit was critical as it caused depresurization and exposure to space which made him die three minutes later.
SP-115_SR,A guy was just going about his business when his suit was ripped. Why did he pass away three minutes later?,"He was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs.","The answer option states that the man was an astronaut on a space walk, repairing his suit that ripped. This scenario explains the cause of his death being related to the suit being ripped and the timeframe of three minutes between the incident and his passing away. This is plausible due to the urgency and seriousness of such a suit failure in the harsh environment of space, making it a rational deduction."
SP-115_CR,"A man was swimming in a sea, when he had a small injury and he lost only a small amount of blood, a minute later, he died in a painful way","When he started bleeding, a shark noticed and ate him.","Even though the man only lost a small amount of blood, a shark was able to smell it from miles away and attack the man."
SP-116,How can you physically stand behind your friend as he physically stands behind you?,By standing back to back.,"This option meets the criteria of physically being behind one another, while also being a feasible solution, as it requires no manipulation of space or time, and only relies on a positional change."
SP-116_SR,How can you stand physically behind your friend while he stands physically behind you?,By standing back to back.,This is the answer option and relates to a physical position of people standing back to back.
SP-116_CR,Two men are using a ladder but both are face-to-face and can't pass each other. How's that physically possible ?,The ladder is set horizontally and two people are hanging from it one going from left to right and the other one from right to left,"This riddle employs wordplay and conceptual thinking. Through the use of imagery, it prompts listeners to consider a scenario where two people are facing each other on a ladder, which initially seems impossible to resolve. However, the solution lies in the orientation of the ladder itself, challenging our default understanding of spatial relationships and forcing us to consider a horizontal orientation for a typically vertical object. By twisting our perception of reality and utilizing the metaphor of 'walking on air,' this riddle invites us to exercise critical thinking and explore creative solutions."
SP-118,"All the electricity was out in town and none of the street lights or traffic signals had power. A dark limousine was cruising down the newly paved blacktop, with its headlights off. A young boy dressed totally in black (with no reflector) stepped out to cross the street. The moon wasn't out and the boy had no flashlight, yet the driver stopped to let the boy cross the street. How did the driver see the boy?",The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.,The only way the driver could see the boy is if there was natural light available despite the absence of electrical lighting.
SP-118_SR,"There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster?",The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.,"Despite the absence of power and functional light sources, the driver could see the boy due to the presence of natural light during the daytime."
SP-118_CR,"The sea was really stormy, it was raining heavily and it was a cold night, however the crew were completely comfortable and warm. How is that possible? ",The crew were not cruising in the sea.,"The answer explains that the crew was not cruising in the sea, implying that they were in a sheltered location and not directly exposed to the harsh weather conditions."
SP-119,"Four cars come to a four way stop, all coming from a different direction. They can't decide who got there first, so they all go forward at the same time. They do not crash into each other, but all four cars go. How is this possible?",They all made right-hand turns.,"The cars did not crash because they each moved in a different direction, allowing for their simultaneous movement."
SP-119_SR,"Four automobiles, each approaching from a separate direction, arrive to a four-way stop. They can't decide who arrived first, so they all proceed at the same time. They do not collide, but all four automobiles are destroyed. What makes this possible?",They all made right-hand turns.,"The cars all proceeded in a way that allowed them to avoid colliding with each other, which fits the scenario of making right-hand turns at a four-way stop."
SP-119_CR,"10 people are sitting on a table and all are stealthy taking food off of other people's plates. After they get up from the table, nobody is hungry and all have eaten the same amount. How's that possible? ",They were sitting on the rounded table and all of them were doing the same thing.,This explains how everyone ended up with the same amount of food and why no one was hungry despite initially taking food from each other's plates.
SP-124,A man was born in 1898. He is still alive now at the age 33  How is this possible ?,he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.,"This interpretation resolves the chronological paradox and provides a logical explanation for the man being alive in 2023, as he was referring to the room name instead of a year."
SP-124_SR,"In 1898, a guy was born. He is still living at the age of 33.  How is this even possible?",he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.,"The man was not born in the year 1898, but rather in room 1898 of a hospital, and thus he is currently 33 years old and still living."" 
This answer is a straightforward explanation that aligns with the clue ""He is still living at the age of 33"", and it highlights the double meaning in the riddle's phrase ""in 1898""."
SP-124_CR,"A man went to Italy to celebrate his birthday, but he only had his phone with himself. How's this even possible?",Italy was name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in.,"This highlights the power of language and its ability to shape our perceptions. By introducing the notion of an Italian restaurant, the riddle challenges our immediate assumptions and invites us to reconsider the reality presented from a different perspective."
SP-125,"A man is late for an appointment and, in his haste, takes a corner so fast that only two wheels were on the pavement. A policeman is standing on the corner, but he did not give him a ticket. Why?",He was on a motorcycle.,The policeman did not give him a ticket because the man was on a motorcycle and two-wheeled vehicles taking a corner at speed is not a violation.
SP-125_SR,"A man is late for an appointment and takes a bend so quickly that just two wheels are on the pavement. A cop is waiting on the corner, but he hasn't issued him a ticket. Why?",He was on a motorcycle.,The unique nature of a motorcycle explains why the cop did not issue a ticket for a violation they might normally enforce.
SP-125_CR,"A thief was running when he passed a policeman as well, but nobody stopped him. Why?","Although he was a thief, he wasn't stealing something at that time",The policeman had no reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing as he was not stealing something at that time.
SP-126,"Four men sat down to play, They played all night till the break of day. They played for gold and not for fun, With separate scores for every one. When they had come to square accounts, They all had made quite fair amounts. Can you explain the paradox, If no one lost, how all could gain?",The men were musicians..,"The riddle is paradoxical. The answer option suggests a creative and meaningful resolution to the paradox wherein the men were musicians""

I will provide you more riddles and hypotheses so we can practice these tasks. Please give me some feedback on how I can improve my response."
SP-126_SR,"Four men sat down to play, and they played all night until the sun came up. They played for gold, not for pleasure, with individual scores for everyone. They had all earned good money when it came to square accounts. Can you explain the paradox: If no one loses, how can everyone win?",The men were musicians..,The only way to resolve the paradox is to consider the game itself is not competitive but rather a collaborative performance.
SP-126_CR,A group of people were shooting each other. They shot their friends in heads and also in other parts of the bodies. They had a lot of pain but nobody died. How is that possible?,They were using fake guns like in paint ball,"the fact that nobody died even though they shot their friends in the head and other body parts suggests that the weapons used were not lethal, which is consistent with the hypothesis of using fake guns."
SP-127,"Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is carrying three pieces of gold each piece weighing one kilogram. While taking a walk he comes to a bridge that has a sign posted saying the bridge could hold only a maximum of 80 kilograms. John weighs 78 kilograms and the gold weighs three kilograms. Johnny reads the sign and still safely crossed the bridge with all the gold. How did he manage this?","Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.","The only way he can juggle three heavy pieces of gold, is by having a special talent."
SP-127_SR,"Imagine Johnny, a party clown, is clutching three gold coins, each weighing one kilogram. While walking, he comes upon a bridge with a sign stating that it can only handle a maximum of 80 kilos. The gold weighs three kilos and John weighs 78 pounds. Johnny reads the notice and crosses the bridge safely with all of the riches. How did he pull it off?","Johnny is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.","The juggling skill of Johnny allows him to control the gold coins in the air, thereby reducing the total weight exerted on the bridge."
SP-127_CR,"Picture Robert, an adept circus performer, carrying five silver spheres, each weighing two kilograms. While trekking, he stumbles upon a rickety old bridge with a sign pronouncing that it can only bear a maximum of 90 kilograms. The silver spheres weigh ten kilograms and Robert weighs 81 kilograms. Robert sees the sign and crosses the bridge securely with all his treasures. How did he manage to do this?","Robert is a clown so he has mastered juggling. When he came to the bridge he judged the gold, always keeping one piece in the air.","This suggests an explanation for how Robert was able to cross the bridge without violating the weight restriction. By suggesting that Robert is a skilled juggler, the audience is directed to consider how Robert might have manipulated the silver spheres in such a way as to redistribute their weight."
SP-128,"Monica took part in a furiously competitive race, which she won due to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not allowed to collect the winning trophy. Why?",Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.,"The answer option reveals that Monica is the name of the horse that won the race, which suggests the reasoning is based on the fact that horses lack the physical capabilities to collect trophies themselves, and that awards are typically bestowed upon their owners or jockeys instead."" 

I hope this response is to your satisfaction, let me know if you would like me to explain my logic further or provide me with any feedback on how I can improve!"
SP-128_SR,"Monica competed in a very competitive race, which she won thanks to her speed and agility. Despite this, she was not permitted to accept the winning trophy. Why?",Monica is the name of the horse that won the race.,"The answer option reveals that Monica is the name of the horse that won the race. This shifts our perspective to consider the possibility that the race is actually a horse race, wherein the winning trophy is awarded to a human involved in the race, not the horse itself."

How did Mark knew about that ?","The video tape was so absurd that if James had seen it, he would've never told Mark that it was really good",Mark's knowledge about James not having seen the video tape is based on the fact that James would have disagreed with Mark's opinion if he had seen the tape.
SP-130,"In 1990, a person is 15 years old. In 1995 that same person is 10 years old. How is this possible?",The years are in B.C.,"The question seems illogical, but the answer and hypothesis highlight the explicit use of B.C. (Before Christ) years, which counts years in reverse and with a larger number denoting earlier times. The logic behind age progression in B.C. becomes reversed compared to A.D."
SP-130_SR,A person is 15 years old in 1990. That same person is ten years old in 1995. What makes this possible?,The years are in B.C.,The years are in B.C. The 1990 is in Regular Dating while the 1995 is in BC Dating.

Thus, the cited years become progressively earlier, not later, thereby resolving the conundrum."
SP-131,"Bouncing Bob was riding a particularly risky horse when suddenly its bridge came off. As they raced down the road, a screaming Bob lung to the horse's ears for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye, Bob saw a car coming, and realizing the horse was completely out of control, he panicked. Failing his arms about, he accidentally caused the horse to come to an abrupt halt. What could Bouncing Bob have done to make the horse stop?",Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.,"Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?""

The relevant sentence here is: ""Each daughter shares the same brother.""

This shows that each of the six daughters has the same brother, meaning that the brother is a sibling to all of them, and not individually. 

This means that the six daughters have a total of one brother, bringing the total number of people in the family to nine. 

Therefore, there is no confusion, and 11 is the correct answer, as this is the total number of people in the family, with six daughters, one brother, and two parents."
SP-131_SR,Bouncing Bob was riding a very dangerous horse when its bridge suddenly collapsed. A screaming Bob sprang for the horse's ears as they sped down the road. Bob spotted a vehicle approaching out of the corner of his eye and worried when he realized the horse was entirely out of control. He unintentionally brought the horse to a standstill by flailing his arms around. What might Bouncing Bob have done to bring the horse to a halt?,Bob accidentally put his hands over the horse's eyes. If a horse can't see he will automatically stop.,"Covering the eyes would interfere with the horse's ability to see its surroundings, inducing a stop.""

SP-131_CR,"Tricky Tim was on an adrenaline-filled motorcycle ride when suddenly the brakes malfunctioned. As they sped along the highway, a frightened Tim clung to the handlebars with all his might. From his peripheral vision, Tim spotted a truck approaching and, realizing his motorcycle was completely out of control, he began to panic. Flailing his arms about in his fear, he accidentally caused the motorcycle to slow down and stop. What could Tricky Tim have done to make the motorcycle stop?","Tim accidentally hit the motorcycle's engine kill switch. When a motorcycle's engine is cut off, it will naturally decelerate and eventually stop.","This answer suggests a possible action for Tricky Tim to have taken, which aligns with the context of the scenario."
SP-132,"A large truck is crossing a bridge 1 mile long. The bridge can only hold 14000 lbs, which is the exact weight of the truck. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck, but the bridge doesn't collapse. How is that possible?",Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.,The weight of the truck is balanced with the fuel spent to get to the middle of the bridge.
SP-132_SR,"A huge truck is crossing a mile-long bridge. The bridge can only support 14000 pounds, which is the weight of the vehicle. The vehicle gets it halfway across the bridge before coming to a halt. The bridge does not collapse because a bird lands on it. How is this even possible?",Because it has driven a half mile - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.,"The weight of the fuel consumed would be subtracted from the total weight of the truck, making it lighter than the bridge's weight limit."
SP-132_CR,"A car elevator in a high-rise building can carry a maximum weight of 10,000 lbs. One day a worker drove an operational car weighing 10,000 lbs from a long distance to get into the elevator. He didn't notice a car was hiding in the rear and moved the car into the elevator. However, the elevator worked as usual, how is that possible?
",Because it has driven a long distance - you would subtract the gas used from the total weight of the truck.,"The reasoning is based on the factual knowledge that gasoline, even in small amounts, has weight. The burned gasoline would have been consumed during the long drive, reducing the total weight of the car. Therefore, the critical connection is the concept of weight reduction through the consumption of gasoline, allowing the car to fit within the elevator's capacity."
SP-133,"A store has on sale a computer and word processor small enough to fit in your pocket. It can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write in all languages. A delete device will correct any error. No electricity is required to operate it. The price? Only a few cents! How can the store make a profit by selling it so cheap?",The computer is a wooden pencil with an eraser.,"The question describes a device that can perform basic maths operations, write in all languages, correct errors, and doesn't require electricity. The answer matches these criteria as wooden pencils can be used to write and perform basic calculations, while the eraser corrects errors. Furthermore, pencils satisfy the linguistic condition as they can write in any language. In addition, pencils are inexpensive yet profitable for retailers at the same time which aligns with the profit-making hypothesis in the question."
SP-133_SR,"A computer and word processor tiny enough to fit in your pocket are available for purchase at a shop. In all languages, it can add, multiply, subtract, divide, and write.

SP-134_SR,"A guy embarks on a voyage between Mexico and the United States. He makes $300,000 from his trip despite not stopping at any ports or even leaving the stateroom. How?",He's a smuggler.,"The only way to explain the man's financial gain without leaving his cabin is through illicit activity. The hypothesis of smuggling suggests a logical reason for his financial success, as it is a practice dependent on illegal trafficking of goods or substances, bypassing standard trade procedures and their implications."
SP-134_CR,"A guy goes to a football stadium for each time their team has a match, and yet he is left with a lot of money at the end of the year. How?",He is the coach of the football team.,This highlights the distinction between regularly attending matches as a supporter and being intimately involved with the team as a member of the coaching staff.

Why?",The patient in the ambulance is dead.,"The only way the ambulance would not be rushing the patient to the hospital is if the patient was dead, and subsequently, the urgency of the situation was diminished."
SP-138,"There are 2 cops parked along a one-way street looking for traffic violations. They spot a taxi driver going in the wrong direction, yet they do nothing. Why?","The taxi driver wasn't driving at the time, he was walking.",This suggests that the answer hinges on the distinction between driving and walking and the different rules that apply to each in terms of moving in the right direction.

Why did he fire the watchman that saved his life?",The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.,"The riddle suggests that the watchman fell asleep at his post. This is a violation of the man's trust and the watchman's responsibilities as an employee. Even though the watchman attempted to make up for this mistake by sharing his dream and saving the man's life, it is reasonable for the man to dismiss him for his negligence and breach of duties."
SP-144_SR,"When a man leaves for a business trip one morning, he discovers that he left some paperwork at his office. Sir, don't get on the plane, the night watchman commands as he stops him as he runs into his office to retrieve it. Last night, I had a dream that the plane would crash and everyone would perish. He honors his word, and the man decides not to go. As expected, the plane crashes, killing everyone on board. The following morning, the man rewards the watchman with $1,000 for saving his life before dismissing him. Why did he let go of the watchman who kept him alive?",The watchman was fired for sleeping on the job.,"The watchman was rewarded for saving the man's life, but the man realized he was asleep on the job, which led to his dismissal."
SP-144_CR,"When a woman is about to leave for an overseas conference, she realizes she left her presentation slides at her workplace. ""Miss, don't board the ship,"" the security guard pleads as he stops her while she dashes into the office to fetch them. ""I had a dream last night that the ship would sink and everyone aboard would drown."" Heeding his warning, she decides not to go. As predicted, the ship sinks, with no survivors. The next day, the woman rewards the guard with a $5,000 bonus for saving her life before letting him go. Why did she dismiss the guard who saved her life?",The security guard was fired for sleeping on duty.,"The guard's warning turns out to be accurate, the ship sinks as predicted and the woman heeds his warning, rewarding him for saving her life but she then dismisses him because he was awake and not asleep on duty."
SP-145,"A man was looking through a 6th floor window,  thought for a minute then jumped,  but did not die or get hurt at all. How?",He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.,The key to solving this riddle is paying attention to the perspective and context of the man's actions. This requires a shift in thinking from the man actually being inside the building to him being outside and approaching the window from the outside.
SP-145_SR,A man was staring out a sixth-floor window when he decided to jump. He did not perish or get any injuries. How?,He jumped in the window. He was outside the window to wash it.,"This scenario provides a logical explanation that aligns with the context of the riddle, as it explains that the man was not actually inside the window, but outside, and his action of 'jumping' was not a suicidal attempt."
SP-145_CR,"A man was in a concert when he jumped on the audience, but nobody got him and he was seriously injured. How did that happen?","He wasn't the performer, so when he jumped nobody cared",The audience's response differs as the man is not the performer.
SP-148,There are two bodies on the floor. They are surrounded by water and broken glass. How did they die?,The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.,"This riddle purposefully creates ambiguity by not specifying the type of bodies, which allows for the unexpected interpretation of them being goldfish. The scenario provided aligns with the conditions of the surrounding water and broken glass, indicating the likely cause of death for the goldfish."
SP-148_SR,Two bodies are on the floor. They're surrounded by water and shattered glass. How did they perish?,The bodies were goldfish because their fishbowl got knocked over onto the floor and broke.,The goldfish were knocked over along with their bowl and died due to dehydration.
SP-148_CR,They are a couple of friends that are playing in water. Suddenly they get suffocated and die although they had their heads outside the water,"The friends were fish, playing in the water.","The friends were fish playing in the water and died because they had their heads outside the water, and fish breathe through their gills. Therefore, this scenario satisfies the question's condition that the friends die even though their heads were outside the water."
SP-149,"What question can someone ask all day long, always get completely different answers, and yet all the answers could be correct?",What time is it?,This question fits the description of the riddle as it can be asked multiple times throughout the day and will yield different answers each time while still being valid. The answer aligns with the criteria provided in the riddle setup.
SP-149_SR,"What question can someone ask all day and receive radically different responses, yet all of them might be correct?",What time is it?,"The answer ""What time is it?"" is relevant to the question as the time of day is constantly changing, so the answer to this question will change accordingly."
SP-149_CR,"What's that one number that when added to numbers, don't change them, but when added in other ways, it does increase them",Zero.,"Zero adds no value when added to numbers, but when interacting in other ways, it changes the value of a number."" 

I hope these responses are satisfactory for this task! Let me know if anything needs adjusting or if you'd like to proceed to the next prompt."
SP-150,"Stranger: Does your dog bite? 
Farmer: No. 
All of a sudden the dog bites the stranger on the leg. Yet the farmer was telling the truth! How can this be?",It was not the farmer's dog.,"The key to understanding this riddle is paying attention to the specific details and logical implications. The farmer's answer is truthful because it refers to the dog not biting in general, covering the entire scenario. This riddle uses dramatic effect to draw attention away from the main detail, which is that the farmer explicitly said 'my' dog, implying a possessive relationship. This would not include a stray dog or a dog belonging to someone else. Thus the farmer was truthful in denying that his own dog bit the stranger, while emphasizing the surprising element of the dog bite to catch people off guard.  "
SP-150_SR,"Stranger: Is your dog biting? 
Farmer: No. 
The dog suddenly attacks the stranger on the leg. Nonetheless, the farmer was speaking the truth! How is this possible?",It was not the farmer's dog.,"The farmer's statement was true, the farmer did not have a dog that bites."
SP-150_CR,"A man was in a restaurant, and asked another person how's the food and the guy recommended some dishes and said they're absolutely astonishing. The food was really bad though. How is that possible?",The person that was asked was the owner of the restaurant.,The only individual who would praise the food despite serving bad taste is the owner who has a direct benefit from attracting customers.
SP-151,"Why can't a woman, who is now living in Canada, not be buried in the USA?",Because she is still alive.,"The reason she cannot be buried in the USA is because she is still alive, which is the answer to the riddle. This plays on the typical assumption that she is deceased."
SP-151_SR,Why can't a lady who lives in Canada be buried in the United States?,Because she is still alive.,"The answer reveals that the lady is still alive and therefore cannot be buried anywhere, let alone in the United States."
SP-151_CR,"Why you go to gym everyday, but still can't do a marathon in New York.",Since you're not in new york to do the marathon,"The answer resolves the contradiction by pointing out that the narrator is unable to do the marathon because they are not in New York, despite their daily gym trips."
SP-152,"A man grabbed a woman's ring and pulled on it, then dropped it. How did this save her life?","They were skydiving, and she was unconscious. ","The man pulling the ring would have deployed the woman's parachute, slowing her descent and preventing a fatal impact with the ground."
SP-152_SR,A guy grabbed and yanked on a woman's ring before dropping it. What happened to save her life?,"They were skydiving, and she was unconscious. ","The man pulling the ring is described in the question, and the answer option provides the context that this occurred during skydiving. Skydiving involves jumping out of a plane and relying on a parachute for safe descent, where the ripcord deployment to initiate the opening of the parachute is time-sensitive. Thus, the man grabbing and yanking the ring can reasonably be interpreted as him saving the woman's life by deploying the parachute at the appropriate time, as she would have been unable to do so herself due to being unconscious."
SP-152_CR,"A man took several shots heavily and even fell down from the hit, but he still survived. How's that possible?",They were whiskey shots.,"The man was not shot with a firearm, but rather became intoxicated from alcohol and lost his balance."
SP-153,"Two women and two doctors walk into an ice cream parlor. They each order an ice cream cone. When their ice cream come, there is only 1 strawberry,1 chocolate and 1 vanilla. How come they didn't complain?",One of the women was a doctor.,"The answer option suggests that one of the women was a doctor. This implies that there were not four separate individuals as initially perceived, but rather three. "
SP-153_SR,"Two women and two doctors enter an ice cream shop. Each of them orders an ice cream cone. When their ice cream arrives, there is just one strawberry, one chocolate, and one vanilla flavor. Why didn't they complain?",One of the women was a doctor.,"The answer option reveals a clever twist in the interpretation of the scenario, revealing that one of the 'women' is also a doctor, changing the total number of people and resolving the puzzle."
SP-153_CR,"They were eight students, taking an exam with nobody else inside the room. when the time was up, they were only 7 taken tests. How's that possible? ",One of the students was a examiner.,This explains that there was actually one examiner supervising the exam and only seven students were taking the test.
SP-154,"There are 50 horses and 50 kings riding along an old dirt road. They came to a peach tree with 50 peaches. Each took one, yet there were still 49 left. How is this possible?",Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.,"The answer embodies the wordplay element of this riddle. By interpreting the word 'each' as a name, it creates a unique scenario wherein a single king named 'Each' takes a peach, thus resolving the contradiction."
SP-154_SR,"Along an old dirt road, 50 kings are mounted on 50 horses. They arrived at a 50-peach tree. EachÂ took one, there were still 49. How is that even possible?",Each is the name of one of the kings and he's the only one that took one.,"The question suggests that each of the 50 kings took a peach, which would lead to the logical impossibility of there being 49 peaches left. However, the answer refocuses on the word 'each' and reinterprets it as a proper noun to refer to a single king. This interpretation makes the scenario possible and explains the paradox."
SP-154_CR,"In an ancient village, 30 warriors are equipped with 30 spears. They encountered a stash of 30 golden coins. Each took one, and yet there were still 29 left. How could this be possible?","Each is the name of one of the warriors, and he's the only one who took a coin.","The name 'Each' refers to the name of one of the warriors, and this warrior is the only one who took a coin."" 
This is the logical path to the answer, following the clues from the question, and leading to the hypothesis."
SP-155,"Fred is listening to the radio when it suddenly stops playing. Nobody is with Fred and nobody touches the radio. A few seconds later, the radio resumes playing. How can this be?",Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.,"This explains why the radio stopped and started again without anyone touching it or being near it, as well as explains the timing of the radio turning back on a few seconds later."
SP-155_SR,"When the radio abruptly stops playing, Fred is still listening to it. Fred is alone, and no one plays with the radio. After a brief pause, the radio starts up again. How is this possible?",Fred was driving his car through a tunnel.,"This explains the temporary interruption in the radio broadcast Fred was listening to."" 

This explanation follows the logic path of focusing on clues in the question that involve interruptions and scenarios that could realistically cause such an interruption, ultimately leading to the answer of Fred being in a tunnel with a weak radio signal."
SP-155_CR,"Linda is enjoying a music track on her headphones in flight when the music abruptly stops. No one is around Linda and nobody touches her headphones. A moment later, the music starts playing again. How can this be?",Linda was on an airplane that just went through turbulence and the interference caused the temporary interruption.,"The temporary interruption in the music suggests a external source of interference, and the hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation for this, pointing to turbulence experienced by the airplane. This explains how Linda's music experience could be disrupted without any interaction from others."
SP-159,"A man is discovered dead sitting at his desk, alone in the locked office.  He did not commit suicide and there was no weapons in the room. The only clue is a sealed envelope on the desk in front of him.
How did he die?","The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.","It is unlikely that the man would have died from accidental poisoning if there was no poison in the envelope. If the man did not commit suicide and there was no poison in the room, the only plausible explanation consistent with this clue is that the envelope glue was poisoned."
SP-159_SR,"A guy is found dead at his desk, alone in the closed office.  He did not commit himself, and no weapons were found in the room. A sealed envelope on the desk in front of him is the sole clue.
How did he pass away?","The envelope glue was poisoned and when the man linked the envelope to seal it, he died.","This is the only option that does not require an external element or intervention, making it the most valid choice. It also explains the presence of the sealed envelope, as it was presumably his last action before dying."
SP-159_CR,"Two men are found dead in their house, however there is no sign of one of them killing the other one, neither the sign of any other intruders. How's that possible?",They both comitted suiside.,"As there is no sign of one man killing the other, the focus should be on explanations that do not involve violence or murder. This leads to considering alternatives such as suicide, which fits the given scenario and explains the absence of signs of violence."
SP-160,What question can never be answered with a Yes?,Are you asleep?,"This question fits the criteria as it is a question that can never be answered with a 'Yes'. This is because the very nature of sleep implies that if the question is answered, it can only be answered with a 'No', thereby preventing a 'Yes' response."
SP-160_SR,What question can never have a Yes answer?,Are you asleep?,"If a person is asleep, the nature of sleep incapacitates them from responding, making it impossible to give a 'Yes' reply. Conversely, if a person answers this question, they are awake and would have to answer 'No'."
SP-160_CR,"What question can never be answered with a ""no""?",Are you awake?,This question fits the criteria as if a person is awake they can answer 'yes' and if they are asleep they will not answer or respond with a 'no'.
SP-161,"You're in a room and there is a ghost in the room, but you're the only one in the room. How is this possible?",You're the ghost.,"The only way to resolve the paradox is if you are the ghost, which means you possess ghostly characteristics within the context of the scenario."
SP-161_SR,"You are in a room with a ghost, but you are the only one in the room. What makes this possible?",You're the ghost.,"it is the only explanation that resolves the paradox of being alone and having a ghost in the room"" 

I hope I served your Riddle correctly, please provide me with feedback if necessary as I am always looking to improve my logic."
SP-161_CR,"There is a young woman in her room thinking about her dreams. There is also another dancer in the room that is dancing in her best dress. However, only the young woman can see the dancer. How's that possible?",The young woman is seeing herself in a couple of years becoming a dancer.,The dancer is not physically present but is a figment of the young woman's imagination or a vision.
SP-162,How many gold coins can a leprechaun throw in an empty pot?,"One. After that, it no longer empty.","The answer to the question, based on the specific conditions given, is one."
SP-162_SR,What is the maximum number of gold coins a leprechaun can toss into an empty pot?,"One. After that, it no longer empty.","The answer revolves around the concept that after the first coin is tossed, the pot is no longer empty as it has somebody inside it."
SP-162_CR,There were 10 pigeons sitting in a row. A tiger came and caught one of them and ate it. How many pigeons are left for the tiger to eat?,None of above.,"This question is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to definitively answer with one of the options provided. The riddle does not state that the tiger has eaten the pigeon it caught, and it could have left it untouched. Also, assuming the tiger would eat more than one pigeon at a time, the number of pigeons 'left' for the tiger to eat is technically none of the above, as the answer is not explicitly given.  Thus, the logical path from question to answer is that each option is eliminated due to insufficient information."
SP-163,"Thomas was caught stealing 27 times in one year, yet he was never arrested. How come?",Thomas was a baseball player and was stealing bases.,"The redefinition of the words 'stealing' and 'caught' in the context of baseball allows for a different interpretation of the sentence 'Thomas was caught stealing 27 times in one year', aligning with the clue 'Thomas was a baseball player and was stealing bases'."
SP-163_SR,"Despite being caught stealing 27 times in one year, Thomas was never arrested. Why is this so?",Thomas was a baseball player and was stealing bases.,"This riddle is an example of wordplay, where the term ""stealing"" is used in two different contexts with different meanings. The term ""stealing"" in the context of a baseball player is not typically used in a criminal context, which makes the riddle intriguing. The surprise comes from the double meaning of the word steal"
SP-163_CR,"There was a guy who was really good at intercepting, however, each time he was caught intercepting, he wasn't being sent to jail. How's that possible?",He was intercepting the ball in football and there was no warning for that.,"The riddle uses wordplay on the phrase 'intercepting', which has two meanings. The first, and most relevant to jail, is the criminal act of intercepting goods or information. The second relates to sports, whereby a player intercepts a ball or item."
SP-164,Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come?,The teacher was in an orphanage school.,This explains why there was no objection from parents
SP-164_SR,"When the instructor spanked every child in the class, not a single parent protested. Why is this so?",The teacher was in an orphanage school.,"The answer option states that the school is an orphanage, implying that the children do not have parents to protest. This matches the scenario where no parent protested against the spanking incident in the question."
SP-164_CR,Mark was in the kitchen cooking everyday and yet he wasn't getting paid. He had to buy all the ingredients and everything himself as well. why?,"He was a chef and a dad at the same time. when he was home, nobody was paying him to cook",This suggests that Mark has two separate roles: one as a professional chef and the other as a father who performs cooking duties without compensation.
SP-165,Cleopatra and Anthony were near a fish bowl and somehow they died. What happened?,Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.,"The question makes reference to Cleopatra and Anthony, iconic figures from history. However, the answer states that they were actually fish. This represents a surprising element, using imaginative interpretation to introduce the idea that Cleopatra and Anthony were not human, but rather fish with the same names. This creates the association between the historical figures and these fish. This interpretation is supported by the fact that fish cannot survive without water, and their death outside of the fish bowl can be attributed to this crucial lack of water."
SP-165_SR,Cleopatra and Anthony perished after being near a fish tank. What occurred?,Cleopatra and Anthony were fish and they can't survive without water.,The only way Cleopatra and Anthony could have perished near a fish tank is if they were fish and were not in water.
SP-165_CR,"Two chickens were passing by a really hungry tiger. Tiger however, saw them but couldn't reach them. What happened?",The tiger was in the zoo.,"The tiger's inability to reach the chickens is explained by the fact that it was in a zoo, as zoos use enclosures to keep animals separated and unable to interact with visitors or each other."
SP-167,"There is a bomb on top of a computer. Around the computer there is a phone, a hairbrush, keys and a cup. When the explosion comes which item is destroyed first?",None of above.,"The answer is none of the items mentioned, as the bomb would destroy the computer first."
SP-167_SR,"A PC has a bomb on top of it. A phone, a comb, keys, and a cup are arranged around the computer. Which object is destroyed first when the explosion occurs?",None of above.,"The question asks for the item that will be destroyed first when the bomb goes off, and the answer is none of the items arranged around the computer because a bomb going off will destroy the thing it is on top of, in this case, the computer, and not any of the other items."
SP-167_CR,"A grenade is in a shopping bag. Around the bag, there is a smartphone, a wallet, a bottle of water, and a book. When the detonation occurs, which item is damaged first?",None of above.,"There is a double negative in the riddle: 'None of the above'. This means that one of the listed options is true, meaning the item in the bag is not damaged first."
SP-168,Andy is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. The window is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel. He won't be able to get any food or water and only has two days to escape or he'll die. Andy can't dig a tunnel because it will take him much longer than two days to do it. How will Andy escape from the cell?,Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.,It is the only option that passes the time constraints and uses the resources in the cell.
SP-168_SR,"Andy is placed in a cell with no windows and a dirt floor. He can't reach the window because it's too high. A shovel is the sole object in the cell. He won't be able to find food or water, and he only has two days to flee or perish. Andy is unable to construct a tunnel since it will take him considerably longer than two days. How will Andy get out of the cell?",Andy has to use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window so he can climb up onto it and escape from the cell.,"The answer option coincides with the given clue, as it leverages the shovel as a tool to dig up dirt and form a pile high enough for Andy to climb out from. This option also meets the time constraint, since it would take less than two days to accomplish this task, making it a viable solution."
SP-168_CR,"A woman is stuck on an isolated island with no food, water, or other human beings. The only things she has are a backpack and a fishing rod. She can't fish because there are no fish in the surrounding waters and she can't drink the seawater.

SP-169,"An elevator is on the ground floor. There are four people in the elevator including me. When the lift reaches the first floor, one person gets out and three people get in. The lift goes up to the second floor, 2 people get out, 6 people get in. It then goes up to the next floor up, no one gets out but 12 people get in. Halfway up to the next floor up the elevator cable snaps, it crashes to the floor. Everyone else dies in the elevator except me. How did I survive?","I got off on the first floor.
","This is the only option that has the speaker surviving the accident, as in all other options the speaker is in the elevator when the cable snaps."
SP-169_SR,"The ground floor has an elevator. In the elevator, there are four individuals, including myself. When the lift arrives at the first floor, one person exits and three people enter. The lift ascends to the second level, 2 people exit, and 6 people enter. It then proceeds to the next floor, where no one exits but 12 individuals enter. The elevator wire snaps halfway up to the next story, and it smashes to the floor. Everyone everyone in the elevator dies except me. How did I make it?","I got off on the first floor.
","This is the only option that allows the narrator to survive. This is because when the elevator crashes, everyone who was in it dies, except the narrator, who got off on the first floor. This is the only option that explains the narrator's survival."
SP-169_CR,"There was a heist going on with five different people, but as the plan was expanding to make it better, there were more people that were added. When we were thinking about the car, two people were added. When we were working on the equipment, two other people were added, and one took himself out of the plan. The additions kept happening until there were 20 people. The heist happened, but the police caught everybody except me. How's that possible?",I was the person who left the plan when we're working on the equipments.,"As the narrator is the one telling the story, they must be the person who has not been caught by the police. The only option amongst the answer choices that fits this criterion is that they were the one who removed themselves from the plan during the equipment stage."
SP-170,"Two boxers are in a match scheduled for 12 rounds. (Pure boxing only. There are no kicking or takedown). One of the boxers gets knocked out after only six rounds, yet no man throws a punch. How is this possible?","Both the boxers were female.
","The clue that helps solve this riddle is the phrase ""no man throws a punch"", which implies that the boxers are not male. This allows the possibility that the knockout punch came from a female boxer, making the answer feasible."
SP-170_SR,"A 12-round boxing battle is organized between two boxers. (Only pure boxing. There are no kicks or takedowns allowed). After only six rounds, one of the boxers is knocked out, yet no man throws a punch. What makes this possible?","Both the boxers were female.
","The answer cleverly plays on the gender assumption in the question, as it is possible that the boxers are male, but it is equally possible that the boxers are female, and even though the question did not specify the boxers' gender, the answer intends to clarify that the boxers were female."
SP-170_CR,"There were a group of people including artists, doctors, and nurses all in a flight. The flight crashed before getting to the destination but no man was injured nor died. How's that possible? ",All the people on the flight were female.,The answer 'All the people on the flight were female' answers the question correctly. No man was injured or died because no man was on the flight.
SP-171,"I have a large money box, 10 inches wide and 5 inches tall.  Roughly how many coins can I place until my money box is no longer empty?",One.,The question asks about the minimum number of coins required to make a money box no longer empty. The answer is one because placing a single coin in the money box will make it non-empty.
SP-171_SR,I have a small money box that is 5 inches broad by 2 inches height.  How many coins can I put in my money box till the box will no longer be empty?,One.,"The question is not about the physical capacity of the box given by its dimensions, but rather about changing the status of the box from empty to not empty, which requires only one coin."
SP-171_CR,"there is a restaurant that can fit 20 people, but the owner is not happy with the number of people coming  to the restaurant. Somebody tries to help him by bringing people for the restaurant. how many does he have to bring until the restaurant wouldn't be empty anymore?",One.,The answer of 'One' fulfills the condition that the restaurant is no longer empty.
SP-172,During which month do people sleep the least?,"February.
","The reasoning behind this answer is the short amount of time in the month of February (shortness of the month), regardless of any other factor."
SP-172_SR,Which month does the average person sleep the least?,"February.
","February is the shortest month with 28/29 days, so the total amount of sleep per person is less than in other months."
SP-172_CR,What's the especial day in which all people sleep less than normal days?,Winter Solstice since the day is the shortest,"The Winter Solstice is the option that fits the description of the day with the shortest period of daylight and the longest night of the year, where people tend to sleep less."
SP-173,"Laura says that she can throw a ball so that it flies away from her, will change direction suddenly, and then come right back to her all by itself. Is that even possible?","Yes, if she throws it straight in the air.
","This riddle can trick people who haven't experienced what happens when you throw a ball into the air. The key here is understanding the behavior of a ball when it is thrown upwards, which is explained in the hypothesis."
SP-173_SR,"Laura claims that she can toss a ball so that it flies away from her, changes course abruptly, and then returns to her on its own. Is that even conceivable?","Yes, if she throws it straight in the air!
",This is possible due to the forces of gravity and the motion of the ball.
SP-173_CR,"I have a friend who claims that he has a especial kite that it's 10 kilograms, however, he can throw it towards a direction and at some point that he can say exactly when, the kite will change directions and comes straight back to him. How's that possible?","The kite is too heavy to fly so the only reasonable answer is that the kite is always thrown towards the sky and because of its weight, it can be expected that at a particular time, it wil change directions and comes straight back to him.",This is the reasonable explanation as there is no other possibility because the kite is too heavy to be manipulated by the air pressure.
SP-174,"A man pushes his car until he reaches a hotel. When he arrives, he realizes he's bankrupt. What happened?",He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.,"The only way to make sense of the man pushing his car is by considering a board game, specifically Monopoly. This distracts from the real world where pushing a car has nothing to do with bankruptcy"
SP-174_SR,"Until he arrives at a hotel, a man pushes his vehicle. He realizes he is bankrupt when he gets there. What took place?",He's playing Monopoly and he lands on a space with a hotel and doesn't have the money to pay the fee.,"The only way to make sense of the man pushing his vehicle and becoming bankrupt is by linking it to the rules of Monopoly, a popular board game."
SP-174_CR,"A tower stands in front of a horse, and the horse jumps over. Both the horse and the tower are fine. Why?",It is on the chessboard.,"The riddle uses metaphorical language to describe a situation that would be physically impossible in real life. The answer acknowledges this fact and reveals that the scenario is not taking place in reality, but within the context of a game of chess, in which the horse and the tower represent chess pieces with specific rules and abilities."
SP-175,A woman enters a room and presses a button. Within seconds she instantly loses 20 pounds. How did she lose the weight?,"The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.
","The answer suggests that the woman entered an elevator and pressed a button for it to go down. The initial scenario of a woman entering a room and pressing a button matches the first part of the hypothesis, but the added detail of the elevator accelerating downward matches the second part of the hypothesis. This causes her to experience a loss in weight, coinciding with the weight loss described in the question."
SP-175_SR,A girl comes into a small room and pushes a button. it didn't take too long until she loses 20 pounds. what happens that she loses that amount that fast ?,"The room is actually an elevator. When she gets inside to go down, the elevator accelerates downward, making her weight temporarily lower.
","This riddle is an imaginative take on the concept of an elevator accelerating downward, effectively reducing an individual's weight. The girl's action of pushing the button initiates the elevator's descent, setting this weight-loss scenario in motion."
SP-175_CR,"A man steps into a chamber and activates a switch. In a matter of seconds, he becomes 15 kilograms lighter. How did he lose the weight?","The chamber is actually a lift. When he gets inside and the lift descends rapidly, the quick downward motion temporarily reduces his weight.","This suggests a connection between the chamber and a lift, with the chamber's function being to induce a temporary loss of weight."

SP-179,A man is in a grocery store and fills a shopping cart. He walks out of the store without paying but no one stops him and no one calls the police. Why?,The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.,This explains why no one stops him or calls the police because the man is an employee of the store and was doing his job tasks related to maintaining the store's cleanliness.
SP-179_SR,"In a grocery store, a man fills a shopping basket. He walks out of the store without paying, and no one stops him or calls the cops. Why?",The man is an employee of the store and was filling the cart with trash to take out to the trash can.,The man is an employee of the store and his actions are consistent with his job description.
SP-179_CR,"A man walks in a hall, and hit somebody to death. He walks out and nobody stops him or calls police on him. Why?",The man is a boxer and he was just playing a box match. He won and he's leaving the hall right now.,The man's actions are not considered a crime but a part of the sport of boxing.
SP-180,"If you were alone in a dark room, with only one match and an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to choose from, which would you light first?",None of above.,"The matchstick is the only source of light in the room and cannot be discarded. Hence, it has to be lit first to illuminate the other objects."
SP-180_SR,"Which would you light first if you were alone in a dark room with just one match with an oil lamp, a fireplace, and a candle to select from?",None of above.,"The matchstick is the source of light in this scenario and thus, it is the first to be lit."
SP-180_CR,"A man is a chef with five dishes to make in half an hour: Crispy Smashed Potatoes, Picadillo, Zuppa Toscana, Classic Pot Roast, and also potatoes. Which one does he have to make first?",None of above.,"At first glance, one may assume that the chef should focus on the longest cooking dishes first, or prepare the dishes in a order that optimizes proximity on the stovetop or in the oven. However, upon closer inspection, the question does not specify any time constraints for preparing the dishes nor any other clues about the chef's immediate priorities. In truth, the chef has no dishes to prepare, as 'potatoes' were listed twice, creating an illogical scenario where the number of dishes to prepare is inconsistent with the known list of dishes. This riddle employs both misdirection and wordplay, encouraging the listener to consider preparation strategy while the critical observation should have been directed at the list of dishes itself. Thus, the answer is none of the above, as the list of dishes is illogical and does not require preparation."
SP-185,"How could a man go outside in the pouring rain without protection, and not have a hair on his head get wet?",He is bald.,"The only way hair staying dry is guaranteed is if the man is bald, ensuring there is no hair to become wet."

This refers to the expression taking the proverbial banana, meaning to be the winner or the favoured one. Hence the answer is none of the above as they are not taking the banana."
SP-188_SR,"Who will grab the banana first if a monkey, a squirrel, and a bird race to the top of a coconut tree?",None of above.,"By process of elimination, considering the monkey is faster than the squirrel and bird, and the squirrel is faster than the bird we are left with the option that is not one of the above options. "
SP-188_CR,"A rooster and a bull were expecting their first child, but since they were having a competition, they wanted to precipitate the process. Which one of them gave birth first?",None of above.,"This question is asking for the option that expresses 'none of the above.' The answer is not specifically about who gave birth first, but rather that the story illustrates an event that did not happen."
SP-192,"A group of ten ostriches are in a field. If four of them take off flying, how many are left in the field?",None of above.,"This is a common riddle relying on irony. If ostriches are known for their ability to fly, this would be a simple math problem of subtracting flying ostriches from the initial amount. However, since ostriches can't fly, the action of them taking off into the air is actually flightless. Therefore, the total number of ostriches in the field remains as ten."
SP-192_SR,Ten chickens are gathered in a field. How many of them remain on the field if four of them take off flying?,None of above.,"This is a mathematical puzzle that requires basic subtraction. Initially, there are ten chickens on the field. If four of them take off flying, we subtract four from ten, resulting in six remaining on the field. Therefore, the correct answer is six."
SP-192_CR,"If we have two bulls, and each cow can produce two gallons of milk every day. How much milk do we have after 2 days?",None of above.,"The cows produce a combined total of 4 gallons per day. After the first day, they will produce 4 gallons, and after the second day, 4 gallons again. This gives a total of 4 + 4 = 8 gallons. However, the question states that each bull is a cow, and we have two bulls, meaning we have two cows. Thus, the correct answer is None of the above."
SP-193,Two people were playing chess and both won. How did this happen?,They were playing against other opponents.,"This answer aligns with the riddle's premise, resolving the apparent contradiction of two winners in a single chess game between two players. Thus, the logical connection to the answer is established."
SP-193_SR,Both persons who were playing chess won. What caused this to happen?,They were playing against other opponents.,The key to resolving this puzzle lies in understanding that the two persons were not playing against each other but against separate opponents.
SP-193_CR,"Two chefs were making food, at some points both poured a salt and pepper into their food, however the food wasn't too spicy afterall when customers were eating it. How's that possible?",Two chefs were making two different foods and they didn't add the spices twice to the same food.,"The spices were not doubled up in any single dish, which would have made it too spicy. Each dish received a normal amount of spices, resulting in a balanced flavor that was not overly spicy."" 
This answer option provides a logical and coherent explanation that resolves the contradiction in the riddle. It explains that the two chefs were preparing separate dishes and only added the spices to their respective dishes, ensuring that the spices were not overused in any one dish."
SP-194," A hiker arrives near a lake. He sees a sign where it is written ""No swimming allowed."", but the duck jumps into the water. Why?

SP-195," Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them? ",None of above.,"The answer is 'None of the above' because if you add up the ducks going to the pond, and the ducks who got lost, you get 13 + 5 = 18 ducks. This number is greater than the total number of ducks (27) less the ducks staying home (13), which is 27 - 13 = 14. This means that the statement 'Nine of them are at the pond' is incorrect and the answer is 'None of the above' "
SP-195_SR," Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them? ",None of above.,"The answer starts with the fact that there is a number problem here. When you subtract those ducks from the total, you get 27 - 5 - 13 - 9 =  4. So the rest of the ducks are the ones that got lost, went to the pond, or stayed home."

SP-196,"Ten fish are in a tank. Two fish drown. Four fish swim away.Three fish die.
How many fish are left in the tank?",None of above.,"The total number of fish in the tank is ten but several groups of fish are mentioned which should not be added together, because none of the operations mentions the tank."
SP-196_SR,A tank contains ten fish. Two fish drown. Four fish are swimming away.Three fish perish.Â How many fish are there left in the tank?,None of above.,The total number of fish remains at ten fish. Drowning and swimming away and perishing describes the action of the fish but does not impact the overall count.
SP-196_CR,"A chopper had ten pigeons inside and threw all of them out to die. However, there were some tall trees that could've survived them. How many survived?",None of above.,"The riddle states that the pigeons were thrown out to die, but some tall trees could have survived them. This suggests that the pigeons did not die despite the trees. However, the question states that none of the pigeons survived, which is contradictory. This contradiction reveals that the answer is none of the above."
SP-197," A woman went to Virginia to get a job. She promised her mother she would come back and visit sometime. Then, in the middle of winter, her mother shouted, ""April is here!"". How is this possible? ",The woman's name is April.,"The question is tricky because it makes you think in terms of seasons and time of the year. However, if you consider that the woman's name is April, it would fit the mother's statement, 'April is here'""."
SP-197_SR,"A woman travelled to Virginia to look for work. She promised her mother that she would return someday. Her mother then exclaimed, ""April is here!"" in the dead of winter. What makes this possible? ",The woman's name is April.,"The mother's statement, 'April is here!' is an expression of her excitement and longing for her daughter's return, not a comment on the season."
SP-197_CR,"A man was asking somebody where is you?, the man then pointed out to the person asking the question. How's that possible?",The name of the man who was asking the question was You,"The answer option reveals a play on words, indicating that the man asking the question has the same name as the pronoun used in the question, which is ""you""."
SP-198,"What animal has no wings, but yet will fly?",A caterpillar.,"A caterpillar transforms into a butterfly or moth through metamorphosis, an process during which it gains wings and the ability to fly."
SP-198_SR,What animal does not have wings but can fly?,A caterpillar.,"While the question suggests that animals with wings are capable of flight, it neglects to consider other, less conventional methods of flight. In the case of the caterpillar, it exploits the surrounding wind conditions rather than relying on its own means of propulsion. Thus, a caterpillar exemplifies an animal capable of flight without the aid of wings."
SP-198_CR,What animal does not have legs but can jump?,A tadpole.,"A tadpole, a larval form of amphibians, is an example of an animal without legs that can jump. This sparks the association with the riddle, hence presenting it as the answer."

SP-200_SR,A jet crashed near the border between Canada and America. Where do the surviving go to be buried?,None of above.,"This statement refutes the options presented and prompts you to seek an alternative, none of the above."
SP-200_CR,We have 5 roosters and each one gives 1 egg per day. How many eggs do we have after a week?,None of above.,"The question states that each rooster lays one egg per day and that there are five roosters in total. This means that the total number of eggs collected in one day is 5. However, in one week, there are 7 days (the question specifies a week). So if you collect 5 eggs each day for 7 days, the total number of eggs collected would be 35. None of the options match the answer 35, therefore none of the above is the correct answer."
SP-201,"Imagine you are in a room, with no doors, windows, or anything. How do you get out?",Stop imagining.,"The answer refers to the initial hypothetical nature of the puzzle, making any solution outside of mental actions uneffective. The only solution is to use a mental action."
SP-201_SR,"Assume you're in a room with no doors, windows, or anything else. How do you escape?",Stop imagining.,"The question is a hypothetical scenario that places you in a room with no apparent means of escape, such as doors or windows.

What's the best thing to do in that situation?,Waking up.,"Waking up is the only option that directly takes you out of the dream and renders you safe from the tiger; since the danger is imaginary, taking physical actions to protect yourself would be futile."
SP-202,"I buried a stone in the ground, and it grew and produced fruit. How is this possible?","The stone was actually a seed, not an ordinary stone. The seed of a cherry is called a stone.","seemingly impossible scenario of a stone growing and producing fruit can be explained by the unique nature of certain seeds, specifically the seed of a cherry."

This plays on the double meaning of the word 'stones' and relies on the distinct features of cherry seeds compared to regular stones."
SP-203,How many birth days does the average person have?,They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.,"While people commonly have annual birthdays, the reality is every person only experiences a single birth day in their lifetime."
SP-203_SR,How many birth days do most people have on average?,They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.,"Annually, people celebrate their birthday, marking one day of the year to commemorate their birth date, however, they actually only have one birth day in their lifetime."
SP-203_CR,"From elementary school to collage, how many ""first day of school"" does the average person have in their lifetime?",They technically only have one first day of school in their lifetime. That's the very first day they started attending school as a child.,"This question deliberately plays upon the connotation of the phrase 'first day of school'. One interpretation could be that there is a first day of elementary school, followed by a first day of middle school, and then a first day of high school, and so on. This leads to the misconception that the average person has multiple first days of school throughout their academic journey. However, the accurate answer stems from understanding the literal meaning of 'first' as an initial or sole occurrence. Thus, the logical relation is that the phrase refers to the single instance of the first day a person enters any stage of school, marking their entry into the world of education."
SP-204,An electric train is going south at 98 mph. The wind is blowing northeast. Which direction is the smoke blowing?,There is no smoke. it's an electric train!,"Electric trains do not emit smoke, and therefore, the direction of smoke is not a factor in this scenario."

SP-204_CR,A submarine is moving west at a speed of 30 knots. There is a strong current moving east. Where are the trail of bubbles coming from?,There are no bubbles. Modern submarines are designed to move through water without leaving a trail of bubbles.,"The answer option states that there would be no bubbles due to the mechanics of modern submarine design and propulsion, which aligns with the principle of deduction."
SP-206,"There is a pink single-story house and everything in it is pink. The doors are pink, the windows are pink and the top is pink. What color are the stairs?",There are no stairs in a single story house.,As a result of the house being single story there is nothing to paint and therefore no stairs.
SP-206_SR,"The entire single-story home is pink, including the outside. The windows, the top, and the doors are all pink. What are the stair's colors?",There are no stairs in a single story house.,The answer is 'there are no stairs in a single-story house' because a single story house is defined as a house that only has one level and therefore does not need stairs.
SP-206_CR,"A one-story house is built from red bricks. The doors, windows, and roof are all made of red bricks. What color is the basement?",There is no basement in a one-story house built on a single floor.,A one-story house does not have another floor above it.

SP-207_CR,"There were twenty boys with different names in the classroom, All went up to the blackboard and wrote names on the board, however, there was only one name on the board, how's that possible?",All is the name of one of the boys.,"The boy named 'All' writes his name on the board, explaining the singular name despite twenty boys writing theirs."
SP-208,"The more you take, the more you leave behind",Footsteps.,"This riddle is talking about an entity that you take away and the action of taking away leaves something behind. Footsteps fit this criteria because walking and taking steps is an action that we take, and with each step a mark is left behind."
SP-208_SR,"The more you take, the more you abandon.",Footsteps.,The question requires a metaphorical answer and footsteps can be interpreted as taking something (action) and abandoning (footprint).
SP-208_CR,You are running so fast but you're not getting closer. Where are you?,Treadmill.,"Exercise machinery called a treadmill is a relevant contender as its name implies a running track or path, so it can be a misleading wordplay clue. Moreover, the core function of a treadmill is to provide an experience of running or walking without moving forward, making it an apt answer to the riddle."
